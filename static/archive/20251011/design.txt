# Ancient Scroll Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Design

The portfolio opens as an illuminated manuscript or ancient adventure map unfurling across the screen. The background features a parchment texture with subtle animated ink flourishes that occasionally drift across the edges. At the top, "Geva Kipper" appears in an elegant serif font styled like calligraphic chapter headings, with "Software Engineer at Google, working on making AI more helpful and safe" inscribed beneath in smaller script. Directly below, an italicized subtitle in a contrasting color reads: "This portfolio is redesigned daily by AI—a new adventure awaits with each visit."

The core interface presents as a branching narrative tree or story map. Six hexagonal boxes are arranged in an organic, non-linear pattern—some higher, some lower, connected by animated dotted paths that pulse with a soft glow, resembling quest routes on a fantasy map. Each hexagon has a weathered border and contains an illustrated icon representing its project: a repeating waveform pattern for GlglStats, a parking lot bird's-eye view for Ahuzat Dibuk, geometric shapes for 2D Part Orienting, two jesters' hats for The Turing Jest, a newspaper with a quill for Rhymes of Israel, and nested frames for the meta portfolio project.

When hovering over any hexagon, it expands slightly and reveals a torn-paper effect banner that unfurls from its top edge, displaying the project title in adventure-book font. Clicking a hexagon triggers a page-scroll or smooth transition that brings that hexagon to center screen while dimming others. The selected project opens like a book page turning, revealing a cream-colored card overlay with the project description in story format: "In this chapter, our hero created GlglStats..." followed by actual project details. Links appear as wax-sealed scrolls or stamped parchment buttons. The PyData video link shows a small vintage TV icon, news links display as newspaper clippings, and code repositories appear as ancient tomes.

The seventh hexagon, containing social links, sits slightly apart at the bottom-right, styled as a traveler's contact ledger with embossed icons for GitHub (an octopus sigil), LinkedIn (a professional guild seal), and Facebook (a town square icon). Each opens in the same ornate style.

At the very bottom, centered in small italicized text on the parchment: "This tale crafted by Claude (Anthropic), your AI chronicler" followed by an antique pocket watch illustration. Inside the watch face, a dynamic stopwatch displays: "Time elapsed since the last redesign: [X] hours, [Y] minutes, [Z] seconds" counting up from October 11, 2025, 01:00:40. The watch hands subtly tick in real-time.

The entire experience uses warm sepia tones, cream backgrounds, deep browns, and accent colors in burgundy and forest green. Subtle parallax scrolling makes the parchment background shift at a different rate than the hexagons, creating depth. Micro-interactions include ink splatter effects on clicks, quill-scratch sounds (optional), and gentle page-rustle animations during transitions.
