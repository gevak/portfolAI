### Portfolio Design: The Alchemist's Lab

**Overall Concept:**
The website is a single, vertically scrolling page designed as a dimly lit, high-tech alchemist's laboratory. The aesthetic is a fusion of old-world mystery (dark wood, glowing glass, arcane symbols) and modern digital polish (neon glows, clean typography, smooth animations). The background is a dark, subtly textured canvas, perhaps like slate or dark wood, with a faint, slowly moving generative art pattern of glowing lines, hinting at the "AI-generated" nature of the design.

**Header Section:**

At the very top, the name **Geva Kipper** appears in a large, elegant serif font with a soft, white glow. Directly beneath it, in a smaller, clean sans-serif font, is the sentence: "Crafting search and discovery experiences at Google."

Below this, a distinct subtitle is rendered in a monospaced, typewriter-style font, with a blinking cursor effect at the end of the line: `// This lab is procedurally generated by AI each day. Its design is ever-changing.` This subtitle has a subtle "glitch" effect, occasionally shifting a character, reinforcing the AI theme.

**The Alchemist's Shelf:**

This is the main interactive section of the site. Instead of standard boxes, the page displays a long, floating shelf made of dark, polished wood, viewed head-on. On this shelf sit seven distinct, beautifully rendered glass vessels. Six are unique "potion" flasks for projects, and the last is a rack of three smaller "ingredient" vials for social links. Each flask has a faint, colored glow and contains a liquid that subtly swirls on its own. Hovering over any flask causes it to glow brighter, bubble gently, and emit a soft, colored wisp of "steam." The cursor changes to a pointing hand icon.

Clicking on a flask triggers a smooth animation. The flask appears to lift and pour its contents into the center of the screen, where the liquid coalesces into a glowing, card-like modal window that expands to reveal the project details. The background dims further to bring focus to the modal. Clicking outside the modal or on a close button (styled as a fading runic 'x') causes it to dissolve back into particles that flow back into the flask on the shelf.

**The Potions (Project Flasks):**

1.  **GlglStats:** A round-bottom flask containing a vibrant, pulsating liquid in shades of magenta and cyan. Inside, musical notes and tiny graph-like waveforms float and swirl. The label is etched in a script-like font. When opened, the modal has a magenta theme. The links are styled as glowing buttons: one with a 'play' icon for the YouTube video and one with a 'link' icon for the website.

2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk:** A wide, rectangular bottle filled with a liquid that shifts through the colors of a heatmap (deep blue, green, yellow, red). Tiny, abstract car icons and map pins are suspended within. When opened, the modal uses a warm, orange-to-red gradient. The links to the news stories are styled with a 'newspaper' icon, and the Facebook link has its own distinct icon.

3.  **2D Part Orienting:** A tall, crystalline decanter with sharp, geometric edges. The liquid inside is a clear, bright cyan, with slowly rotating, wireframe polygons floating within. The aesthetic is precise and mathematical. The modal has a cool, blue-and-white theme. The link to the project page and code is styled as a button with a branching 'algorithm' or 'geometry' symbol.

4.  **The Turing Jest:** A "potion of levity"â€”a spherical flask with a bright, bubbly, golden liquid. Comedic "laughing face" emojis and question marks bubble up to the surface. The modal has a playful, yellow-gold theme. The link to the site is a button with a "jester's hat" icon.

5.  **Rhymes of Israel:** A flask shaped like a Chrome browser icon, filled with a shimmering, iridescent liquid. Inside, newspaper headlines made of light periodically form and then dissolve into rhyming couplets. The modal is multi-colored and dynamic. The link to the Chrome Web Store is a button styled with a 'puzzle piece' extension icon.

6.  **The Alchemist's Folio (This Site):** A Klein bottle or other impossible-looking geometric flask, containing a swirling vortex that reflects the website's own background. It represents the meta, self-referential nature of the project. This modal would be unique; when clicked, it might briefly zoom out to show the entire page architecture in a wireframe view before displaying the text and the self-referencing link (https://geekip.dev) on a button with a 'recursion' symbol.

**The Ingredient Rack (Contact Links):**

Positioned at the end of the shelf is a small, neat wooden rack holding three identical, small vials, each with a different metallic cap (bronze, silver, gold). They are labeled with simple icons instead of text.
*   **Vial 1:** An etched GitHub Octocat icon.
*   **Vial 2:** An etched LinkedIn 'in' logo.
*   **Vial 3:** An etched Facebook 'f' logo.
Clicking on a vial instantly opens the corresponding link in a new tab, with a subtle "clink" sound effect.

**Footer Section:**

The bottom of the page transitions from the shelf into a dark, stone-floor texture. Two lines of text are centered in a clean, digital font.

The first line reads: `> Design synthesized by the AI model, Claude.`

The second line is styled to look like a digital lab instrument's display, with a glowing green, monospaced font:
`Time Since Last Manual Design: [A live-updating stopwatch showing hours, minutes, and seconds passed since 2025-09-14 01:05:49]`
