The overarching design concept is a "Virtual Tech Expo," utilizing a modern dark-mode aesthetic with deep obsidian backgrounds, sleek metallic containers, and vibrant neon accents (like cyan and magenta) to represent holograms. The typography should rely on a crisp, geometric sans-serif font like 'Space Grotesk' for headings and 'Inter' for readability. 

Upon landing, the user does not immediately see the content. They are greeted by a full-screen, semi-transparent frosted glass overlay (`backdrop-filter: blur`) acting as a security checkpoint. At the center is a hyper-realistic, CSS-rendered "VIP Badge Scanner." Above the scanner rests elegant silver text: "Geva Kipper," followed by the sentence, "Currently engineering scalable software solutions at Google." Below this, a subtle, glitching typewriter effect displays the sub-headline: "This website is re-designed each day by AI and is thus ever-changing." The user must interact with the scanner—either by dragging a virtual lanyard hovering on screen or simply holding a click on a glowing fingerprint/RFID icon. Upon interaction, an LED on the scanner flashes from red to green, a sleek CSS shutter animation triggers, and the overlay slides apart vertically to seamlessly reveal the main single-page content.

Once unlocked, the layout transforms into a horizontal scroller or an isometric CSS grid, presenting the seven sections as literal 3D-styled "Project Booths" on a digital exhibition floor. Each booth is a distinct, elevated card with a glowing base and a holographic inner section. 

Booth 1, presenting "GlglStats," features a backdrop animated with soundwave-like bars compressing into a tight digital code, representing LZ77 compression and pop-music repetitiveness. It prominently features an embedded, sleekly bordered frame for the PyData TLV YouTube presentation (linked to `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo`) and a glowing CTA button linking to `https://glglstats.geekip.dev`. 

Booth 2 is dedicated to "Ahuzat Dibuk." Its design mimics a glowing top-down heat-map of city grid streets with tiny floating parking icons. Floating "press release" placards serve as interactive links to the Channel 13 (`https://13tv.co.il/item/news/domestic/internal/parking-902956407/`) and Mako (`https://www.mako.co.il/nexter-news/Article-ae43964b891bf71027.htm`) news stories, while a separate interactive "social monitor" links to the original Secret Tel-Aviv Facebook post (`https://www.facebook.com/groups/secrettelaviv/posts/10159636301195943/`).

Booth 3, "2D Part Orienting," leans hard into computational geometry. Its aesthetic is industrial and clean, featuring a background of slowly rotating, neon-wireframe polygons. Above the description of the C++ push-plan algorithm is a sleek terminal-window styled button linking to `https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/`. 

Booth 4, "The Turing Jest," is designed like a futuristic miniature boxing arena. Two robotic faces or jester hats sit on opposite sides of the card, with animated "VS" lightning between them. The typography here is slightly more playful, blending AI-tech vibes with comedy, and features a glowing prompt-box button linking to `https://jest.geekip.dev`. 

Booth 5 holds "Rhymes of Israel" and takes the form of a digital high school yearbook merged with a chaotic news-ticker. Sections of the card look like ripped paper revealing glowing code underneath. A prominent Google Chrome logo sits next to the CTA linking to the extension download at `https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eainginjgdkpgolpjniijdihfbeeeklb`.

Booth 6 is the meta-portfolio site itself. Design this booth to look like an "infinite mirror" or an intricate recursive optical illusion using nested CSS borders, acknowledging the self-referential nature of the project. It features a minimalist plaque pointing to `https://geekip.dev`. 

Booth 7 serves as the Expo's "VIP Networking Lounge." It drops the project aesthetic for a luxurious, dark-velvet and neon-sign look. Three distinct, beautifully rendered neon signs (or hovering 3D icons) act as links to GitHub (`github.com/gevak`), LinkedIn (`linkedin.com/in/gevakip`), and Facebook (`facebook.com/geva.kipper`). Hovering over each illuminates the entire booth in the respective brand's color.

At the absolute bottom of the single-page scroll, pinned like an emergency exit sign above the digital floor, is the footer. It displays elegant, monochromatic text stating: "Site architected and generated by AI." Just below it is an active, retro-futuristic digital stopwatch (styled like a red LED 7-segment display). Through JavaScript, this stopwatch must dynamically calculate and tick upward in real-time, showing the precise Hours, Minutes, and Seconds elapsed since the epoch of `2026-02-27 01:24:47`.
