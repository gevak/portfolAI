# Bug Hunter Portfolio Design Concept

## Overall Theme
The website will be designed as a bug-hunting game environment where visitors "debug" their way through Geva Kipper's portfolio. The interface resembles a code editor/terminal with a playful gamified approach.

## Header
At the top, large glitchy text displays "GEVA KIPPER" with a subtitle "Software Engineer @ Google" underneath. Below this is a blinking terminal-style message: "This website is procedurally regenerated daily by AI - what you see is unique to today."

## Navigation
Navigation appears as a "debug console" with tabs labeled: "MAIN", "PROJECTS", "ABOUT", and "CONTACT". The active tab glows with a subtle highlight.

## Background
The background features faint, animated code snippets and occasional "bugs" (small pixel creatures) crawling around that visitors can click to squash (triggering satisfying animations).

## Project Sections
Each project is presented as a "bug ticket" or "debug challenge" in a terminal-style window. As visitors hover over each project box, the box expands to reveal:

1. **GlglStats Bug Ticket #001**
   - Terminal-style header showing "Analyzing repetition patterns..." with a loading bar
   - Description below with animated sound wave visuals
   - "EXAMINE CODE" and "VIEW DEMO" buttons pointing to the links
   - Video thumbnail with a play button for the PyData TLV presentation

2. **Ahuzat Dibuk Bug Ticket #002**
   - Data visualization elements that animate on hover
   - Heat map background that shifts colors
   - "MEDIA COVERAGE" dropdown revealing the news story links
   - "VIEW ORIGINAL RESEARCH" button pointing to the Facebook post

3. **2D Part Orienting Bug Ticket #003**
   - Interactive geometric shapes that rotate when hovered
   - C++ code snippets that highlight different parts as user hovers
   - "REVIEW IMPLEMENTATION" button linking to the project page

4. **Portfolio Website Bug Ticket #004**
   - Meta section designed as "recursive code" that zooms in infinitely
   - Text: "You are here" with a blinking cursor
   - Inception-like animation when hovered
   - "PORTAL" button linking to the actual portfolio site

5. **Connect Bug Ticket #005**
   - Social links presented as "debugging collaborators"
   - GitHub, LinkedIn and Facebook icons designed as bug-hunting tools
   - Each icon animates uniquely when hovered (GitHub rotates, LinkedIn pulses, Facebook glows)

## Interactive Elements
- Scattered throughout the page are clickable "bugs" that when clicked reveal Easter eggs about Geva's coding journey
- A "debug mode" toggle in the corner that switches the site to dark/light theme
- Code snippets from each project appear and disappear in the background

## Footer
The footer features "Generated by [Your AI Model Name]" and an animated stopwatch/terminal clock showing time elapsed since May 4, 2025, counting up in real-time with a blinking terminal cursor.

## Transitions
As users scroll, the transition between sections resembles a debugging process - code being analyzed, bugs being fixed, with satisfying completion animations between sections.

## Responsive Design
On mobile, the experience transforms into a vertical debug console where users can tap through each "bug ticket" sequentially, maintaining the playful debugging theme while optimizing for smaller screens.
