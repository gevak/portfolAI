### **Portfolio Design: "The GevaBot Interview"**

**Overall Vibe and Layout**

The website is a single, full-screen page with a dark, minimalist aesthetic. The background is a very dark charcoal grey (#1A1A1A) with a subtle, slowly shifting, almost imperceptible gradient of deep blue and purple hues, visually representing the "AI-driven daily redesign." The layout is clean and spacious, focusing entirely on the central chat interface. Typography is key: a modern, clean sans-serif font (like Inter or Manrope) for user interface elements and user messages, and a crisp, slightly stylized monospace font (like Fira Code or JetBrains Mono) for the bot's responses to give it a "machine" feel. The overall atmosphere is sophisticated, intriguing, and tech-forward.

**The Initial View and Header**

Upon loading, the user sees a centered chat window. There are no traditional navigation bars. The first element to animate into view is a single chat bubble on the left, from the "GevaBot".

*   **Bot's Welcome Message:** A chat bubble fades in, containing an avatar (a simple, abstract geometric shape or a stylized 'G') and the bot's name, "GevaBot". The text inside types out character by character:
    *   "Hello. I am a bot representation of Geva Kipper, a Software Engineer at Google, currently working on infrastructure for large-scale AI models.
    *   I can tell you about his work. What would you like to know?"

Below this message, three pill-shaped, clickable buttons appear, representing the user's first response. These are the main navigation prompts:
`[ Tell me about his projects ]` `[ What is this website? ]` `[ How can I contact him? ]`

The subtitle, "This interface is procedurally redesigned by AI every 24 hours," is positioned discreetly in the top-right corner of the viewport in a small, light grey font.

**The Chat Interaction Flow**

The entire portfolio is revealed through a turn-based conversation. When the user clicks a prompt button, it disappears and reappears on the right side of the screen as their "sent" message. After a brief, simulated "thinking" pause (indicated by three animated pulsing dots `...` appearing in a new bot bubble on the left), the GevaBot responds with a new message, revealing the requested information. The page automatically scrolls down smoothly to keep the latest message in view.

**Project Presentation Cards**

When the user clicks `[ Tell me about his projects ]`, the bot responds with a new bubble containing five clickable buttons, one for each project/section:
`[ GlglStats ]` `[ Ahuzat Dibuk ]` `[ 2D Part Orienting ]` `[ This Portfolio ]` `[ Socials & Links ]`

Clicking on a project button triggers a new bot response. This response is not just text, but a structured, rich content "card" embedded within the chat bubble. Each card has a consistent, elegant design:

1.  **GlglStats Card:**
    *   **Title:** GlglStats
    *   **Description:** A Python project which measures repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs based on LZ77 compression. It also visualizes repetition patterns in a selection of famous songs.
    *   **Links:** Two prominent, icon-paired buttons below the description: `[ üåê View Live Site ]` and `[ ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Watch Conference Talk ]`.

2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk Card:**
    *   **Title:** Ahuzat Dibuk
    *   **Description:** A Python scraping and data visualization project, collecting statistics on Tel-Aviv car parking lots occupancy and generating heat-maps to be used by residents.
    *   **Links:** Three buttons: `[ üì∞ Read on 13tv ]`, `[ üì∞ Read on Mako ]`, and `[ üí¨ View Original Post ]`.

3.  **2D Part Orienting Card:**
    *   **Title:** 2D Part Orienting
    *   **Description:** A C++ implementation in an open-source computational geometry library (CGAL) of an efficient algorithm for constructing a 'push plan' to orient a given polygon.
    *   **Links:** A single, clear button: `[  </> View Code & Details ]`.

4.  **Meta Portfolio Card:**
    *   **Title:** The "GevaBot" Portfolio
    *   **Description:** You're looking at it! This single-page portfolio is designed as a chat-based interview, built with modern JavaScript and designed to be minimal, interactive, and ever-evolving.
    *   **Links:** A self-referential button: `[ üîó View The Site (Again) ]`.

5.  **Contact & Links Card:**
    *   **Title:** Get In Touch
    *   **Description:** Connect with Geva on the following platforms.
    *   **Links:** Three large, distinct buttons with recognizable logos: `[ GitHub ]`, `[ LinkedIn ]`, `[ Facebook ]`.

**Footer**

A thin, fixed-position footer rests at the very bottom of the page. It is semi-transparent to avoid distracting from the chat content. It contains two pieces of information, aligned to opposite ends of the screen.

*   **Left-aligned:** "Site design by Claude 3 Opus, an AI assistant from Anthropic."
*   **Right-aligned:** A live stopwatch under the heading "TIME SINCE LAST AI REDESIGN". It actively counts up in `HH:MM:SS` format from the specified timestamp of 2025-06-17 01:08:24. This ticker reinforces the theme of an ever-changing, AI-maintained site.
