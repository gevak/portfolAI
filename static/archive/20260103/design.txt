**Visual Concept: The "GlassOS" Aether**

The overall aesthetic should be a highly polished, futuristic "Glassmorphism" operating system interface. The background should not be a static image but a slow-moving, generative WebGL mesh gradient in deep purples, teals, and midnight blues to simulate a living digital environment. The interface sits ‘above’ this background using translucent frosted glass textures. Typography should be crisp, utilizing a monospaced font for data elements (like `JetBrains Mono`) and a clean sans-serif (like `Inter` or `Roobert`) for headlines, creating a high-end engineering vibe.

**The System Bar (Header)**

A semi-transparent status bar runs across the top of the viewport, mimicking a MacOS menu bar but floating with a heavy blur effect.
*   **Left Corner:** Displays "Geva Kipper" in bold white text. Next to it, a pill-shaped badge pulsing softly explicitly states: "Currently Engineering at Google."
*   **Center:** A scrolling marquee text (ticker style) with a glitch effect that reads: *"Version Build 1.0 // This interface is redesigned daily by AI. Architecture is fluid."*
*   **Right Corner:** A functional clock and a WiFi icon that reacts to mouse hover.

**The Desktop Environment (Main Content)**

The main viewport is a free-canvas desktop. Instead of static blocks, the six project sections and the contact section are rendered as draggable, floating "Windows."
*   **Window Behavior:** Each window should look like a frosted glass pane with a thin, glowing border (1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.1)). They should have standard "traffic light" window controls (red/yellow/green circles) in the top left. The windows should be draggable and stackable (clicking one brings it to the front with a subtle z-axis zoom animation).
*   **Initial State:** On load, the windows are scattered artistically across the screen, slightly overlapping, encouraging the user to "tidy up" their digital workspace.

**Window Content Specifications**

1.  **File: GlglStats.exe:** This window is dominated by a dark-mode code terminal aesthetic. The top half embeds the YouTube video of the PyData presentation. Below it, a visualizer bar bounces (simulating audio compression). A large, neon-green "Execute" button links to *glglstats.geekip.dev*.
2.  **File: Ahuzat_Dibuk.py:** Designed to look like a data dashboard. Background features a faint, dimmed heatmap of Tel Aviv. It contains three "System Notification" style cards linking to the 13tv, Mako, and Facebook stories.
3.  **File: 2D_Part_Orienting.cpp:** This window should feature a wireframe polygon vector turning slowly in the background. The text describing the C++ implementation is overlaid in white. A "Source Code" button links to the project page.
4.  **File: The_Turing_Jest.app:** The interior of this window simulates a chat interface. Two chat bubbles (one representing an LLM, one a User) sit above a "Play Now" button linking to *jest.geekip.dev*.
5.  **File: Rhymes_of_Israel.crx:** Styled like the Chrome Web Store entry but simplified. It features a playful, retro-school font for the title. A predominant "Add to Browser" button handles the link.
6.  **File: Recursive_Portfolio.sys:** This is the "Meta" window. It should contain an `iframe` or a recursive visual of the website itself, creating an infinite mirror effect. A label reads: *"You are here. Recursion depth: 1."* linking to *geekip.dev*.
7.  **File: Connectivity (Socials):** A sleek, horizontal window (like a floating dock). It contains three large, 3D-rendered icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Hovering over them causes them to levitate and glow.

**The System Footer**

A fixed, floating pill-bar at the bottom center of the screen acts as the "Task Monitor."
*   **Credits:** Small text on the left reads: *"Architected by Model [Your Model Name]."*
*   **The Temporal Counter:** On the right side of the bar, a digital stopwatch is displayed in a bright, monochromatic red font (`00:00:00`). It must calculate and display the precise time elapsed since the epoch timestamp **2026-01-03 01:08:03**. (If the current date is before this timestamp into the future, the counter should utilize a negative sign or countdown logic; otherwise, it counts up). The milliseconds should flicker rapidly to emphasize precision engineering.
