# Retro Arcade Quest: A Side-Scrolling Adventure Portfolio

The website opens with a pixelated 8-bit aesthetic reminiscent of classic platformer games like Mega Man or Castlevania. The entire viewport displays a side-scrolling dungeon level rendered in vibrant neon colors against a dark purple-to-black gradient background. At the top of the screen, a HUD displays "GEVA KIPPER" in a glowing retro game font, with underneath in smaller text: "Engineering Reality at Google, One Algorithm at a Time." Below that, in an italicized pixel font with a subtle shimmer effect: "⚡ This dungeon regenerates daily through AI magic - no two visits are the same ⚡"

The main gameplay area shows a 2D side-scroller where a pixel art character (representing Geva) stands at the left edge of the screen. The level extends horizontally to the right, featuring seven distinct "zones" or rooms, each separated by ornate pixel art doorways. Each zone has a unique color scheme and environmental theme - the first zone glows with Python-yellow circuitry patterns, the second has parking-lot grid patterns in Tel-Aviv sunset oranges, the third shows geometric wireframe blueprints in cyan, the fourth displays jesters and comedy masks in purple, the fifth features newspaper clippings in red, the sixth is a hall of mirrors in silver, and the seventh is a social hub with interconnected nodes in green.

Each project zone appears initially as a locked door with a glowing "BOSS" indicator. When you click on a door, it dramatically swings open with a satisfying sound effect (visual indication only, actual sound optional), and the zone expands vertically in a smooth animation, revealing the project content inside like a vertical accordion panel. The expanded zone displays the project name in a bold game title font, a brief description in readable modern sans-serif text overlaid on semi-transparent panels, and interactive elements styled as game power-ups: links appear as glowing orbs or treasure chests, the YouTube video embeds as a retro TV screen, and news links as scattered newspaper pickups.

The character avatar actually moves between zones as you interact - when you click a project, the pixel art Geva runs to that zone, jumps through the doorway, and the zone expands. When you close a project (via an X button styled as a pixel art exit sign), the character runs back out and the zone collapses. The character has smooth walking and jumping animations, and occasionally performs idle animations when no interaction occurs (tapping foot, looking around).

Each zone interior uses parallax scrolling backgrounds that shift subtly as you scroll the page, creating depth. The GlglStats zone shows musical notes and waveforms floating in the background. Ahuzat Dibuk displays miniature pixel cars moving through parking grids. The 2D Part Orienting zone has rotating geometric shapes. The Turing Jest zone features floating speech bubbles with "HA HA" text. Rhymes of Israel shows scrolling Hebrew and English text. The portfolio meta-zone has recursive smaller versions of the webpage. The social links zone displays the character standing at a crossroads with signposts pointing to each platform.

Navigation is enhanced with a mini-map in the bottom right corner showing all seven zones as small icons, with completed/visited zones marked with glowing checkmarks and the current zone highlighted with a pulsing border. The mini-map allows quick jumping between zones.

At the very bottom of the page, in a retro arcade machine footer panel with a scanline effect overlay, centered text reads: "LEVEL DESIGN BY CLAUDE (ANTHROPIC) | DUNGEON MASTER AI" followed by a yellow digital countdown timer in the format "TIME SINCE LAST RESPAWN: XXd XXh XXm XXs" counting up from October 12, 2025, 01:05:52, styled like an old-school arcade score counter with glowing segments.

Particle effects add polish throughout - sparkles when hovering over links, small explosions when opening zones, coins or stars floating upward when clicking interactive elements, and a subtle CRT screen curve and scanline shader effect over the entire viewport to complete the arcade cabinet illusion.
