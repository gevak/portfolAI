# Retro OS Portfolio Design Concept for Geva Kipper

## Overall Theme
A nostalgic retro operating system interface reminiscent of Windows 95/98 or early Mac OS, with a dark mode aesthetic. The entire site functions as a virtual desktop where each project is represented as an application window or icon.

## Header Section
- A startup boot sequence animation plays briefly when the page loads
- After "booting up," displays a top menu bar with classic OS elements
- Developer name "Geva Kipper" appears as the OS username in the corner
- A single sentence about current work at Google appears as a "system notification"
- A subtitle appears as a "system message" explaining that the website is redesigned daily by AI and is ever-changing

## Desktop Environment
- Background features a subtle grid pattern or starfield typical of retro OS
- Desktop contains five application icons representing each project
- When clicked, icons "open" into draggable windows with project details
- Mouse cursor changes to a retro pointer design
- Classic startup/shutdown sounds play when opening/closing project windows

## Project Windows
Each project opens as a window with:
- Title bar with project name and minimize/maximize/close buttons
- Scrollable content area with project details
- Authentic retro UI elements like buttons, scrollbars, and window borders
- Project screenshots displayed in "CRT monitor" style frames

### Window 1: GlglStats
- Designed as a "Media Player" application window
- Embedded YouTube video player for the PyData presentation
- Visualizations displayed like an audio analysis tool
- "Open Website" button styled as a classic OS button

### Window 2: Ahuzat Dibuk
- Designed as a "Map Utility" application window
- Heat maps displayed in a retro GIS interface style
- News links appear as "Bookmark" items
- Facebook link styled as a "Share" button

### Window 3: 2D Part Orienting
- Designed as a "CAD Program" application window
- Code snippets displayed in a terminal/code editor interface
- Polygon visualizations shown in wireframe aesthetic
- Link to full project styled as a "Download" button

### Window 4: Portfolio Website
- Meta-recursive window that looks like the current interface
- Creates an "inception" effect with nested windows
- Contains a self-referential link styled as a system shortcut

### Window 5: Social Links
- Designed as an "Address Book" application
- Each social link (GitHub, LinkedIn, Facebook) appears as a contact card
- Hovering over cards creates a "glow" effect
- Clicking animates like opening a contact file

## Footer Elements
- System tray at bottom with classic OS elements
- AI model credit displayed as "OS Version Information"
- Stopwatch shown as a system clock with elapsed time since 2025-05-11 01:09:43
- Classic shutdown button in corner that triggers a fun animation but doesn't actually close the page

## Interactive Elements
- Windows can be dragged, minimized, and restored
- Opening multiple windows creates a layered desktop experience
- Subtle retro UI sounds for interactions (clicks, window movements)
- Easter egg: Konami code (↑↑↓↓←→←→BA) triggers a "cheat mode" with fun visual effects

## Responsive Design
- On mobile, transforms to look like a retro handheld device
- Projects become apps in an app drawer that can be scrolled through
- Maintains the retro aesthetic while ensuring usability on small screens
