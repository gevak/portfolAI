# Quantum Portfolio Design Concept for Geva Kipper

## Core Theme
A quantum computing-inspired interface where the entire page exists in a state of quantum superposition. Projects appear to exist in "parallel realities" with quantum-like visual elements connecting them.

## Header Section
- Geva Kipper's name appears as if materializing from quantum particles
- Single sentence about his work at Google that appears to be typing itself out with a quantum computing-style cursor
- Subtitle with dynamic text animation: "This portfolio exists in multiple states simultaneously, redesigned daily by AI"
- A subtle wave function equation subtly animates in background

## Navigation
- Instead of traditional menu, circular "quantum orbit" navigation where project orbitals can be selected
- Projects appear to exist in parallel dimensions

## Quantum Project Boxes
Each project box has:
- Floating in quantum field with slight parallax effect when moving cursor
- Entangled particle trails connecting all projects
- Projects visually transform when hovered, as if collapsing from multiple quantum states

### 1. GlglStats Box
- Visualizes as a sound wave pattern that transforms into compression patterns
- Animated LZ77 compression visualization as background
- "Observe" buttons for website link and conference video that appear to quantum tunnel into view

### 2. Ahuzat Dibuk Box
- Background shows a subtle heatmap visualization that shifts colors
- Tel-Aviv map that transitions between parking density patterns
- News links appear as "quantum observation points" with small probability clouds

### 3. 2D Part Orienting Box
- Animated polygon outlines that rotate and orient themselves
- C++ code fragments that appear to assemble the shapes
- GitHub link materializes as if compiled from source code

### 4. Meta Portfolio Box
- Recursive visualization of the website within itself, creating an infinite mirror effect
- Self-referential link that appears to bend space around it
- Visual that suggests the website observing itself

### 5. Social Links Box
- GitHub, LinkedIn and Facebook icons exist in quantum superposition
- Links appear to entangle with cursor when approached
- Particle effects connect to user interaction

## Footer
- Credit line: "Designed by Claude AI in a parallel reality"
- Quantum-inspired stopwatch counting time since 2025-05-11 08:28:06
- Time displayed as if in quantum flux, with digits occasionally appearing superimposed

## Colors & Visuals
- Deep space gradients (midnight blues, quantum purples)
- Particle effects that respond to cursor movement and scrolling
- Glowing neon highlights for interactive elements
- Occasional "quantum glitches" where elements briefly appear in multiple states

## Interactions
- Scroll actions shift the quantum probability field
- Mouse movement creates subtle wave interference patterns
- Click actions trigger "quantum collapse" animations where elements solidify from multiple states
- Page transitions mimic quantum teleportation
