# Matrix-Style Portfolio Website Design for Geva Kipper

## Core Design Concept
A dark-themed, single-page portfolio where Matrix-style falling code cascades down the screen continuously. Instead of just random characters, the falling code intelligently forms and reforms into project visualizations, creating an interactive digital rain effect that serves a purpose.

## Header
- Name "Geva Kipper" appears as if typed in real-time with a blinking terminal cursor
- Subtitle: "Currently Engineering at Google" fades in below the name
- A smaller, elegant note states: "This website redesigns itself daily via AI - what you see is unique to today"
- The entire header emerges from falling code that settles into place

## Background & Animation
- Continuous dark background (deep black with subtle dark green undertones)
- Digital rain effect with varying shades of green code characters falling at different speeds
- The falling characters occasionally pulse with light as if data is being transmitted

## Project Sections
Five project boxes appear sequentially as the user scrolls, each materializing from the falling code:

1. Each box initially appears as an amorphous cluster of falling code
2. As the user approaches a section, the code coalescences into a clear project card
3. When fully formed, each project card has:
   - A title formed from brighter, more prominent code characters
   - A brief description that appears to be "decoded" from the Matrix rain
   - Interactive elements (links, videos) that glow with a distinctive cyan highlight
   - A subtle hexagonal border that pulses with energy

## Interactive Elements
- As the cursor hovers over any project, the digital rain around it intensifies
- Clicking a project causes a "code explosion" animation before opening links
- The digital rain subtly follows cursor movement, as if the user is influencing the code flow

## Project-Specific Features
- GlglStats: Visualization shows actual music waveforms encoded in falling Matrix characters
- Ahuzat Dibuk: Heat-map patterns occasionally form within the digital rain around this section
- 2D Part Orienting: Polygons occasionally form and reorient themselves in the background code
- Portfolio Website: Self-referential section where the code forms a miniature version of the site itself
- Links Section: Social icons constructed from code characters that reorganize when hovered

## Footer
- A terminal-style clock counting time since April 12, 2025, with animated digits
- Credit to the AI model appears as if being continuously typed by an invisible entity
- The entire footer seems to be anchored by code that never fully falls off the screen

## Technical Flourishes
- Parallax scrolling effect with multiple layers of falling code at different depths
- Text appears with a combination of "decoding" animations and typewriter effects
- Occasional "glitches" in the Matrix rain that reveal alternative design elements briefly
- Subtle ambient electronic soundtrack that responds to user interaction (optional, user-toggled)
- Mobile adaptation where the code rain becomes more subtle but still forms project visuals

## Performance Considerations
- Progressive loading of animations to ensure smooth initial experience
- Simplified animation mode toggle for users with performance concerns
- Accessible alternative views available through an elegant "terminal command" interface
