# Code Editor Portfolio Design Concept for Geva Kipper

## Main Concept
A dark-themed code editor interface that mimics VS Code or similar IDEs. The entire site functions as if it's a working code editor with proper syntax highlighting, line numbers, and typical code editor elements.

## Layout Structure
- Header bar resembling a code editor top bar with tabs
- Side panel mimicking a file explorer
- Main content area styled as a code file with syntax highlighting
- Status bar at the bottom with metrics/timer

## Color Scheme
- Dark background (#1E1E1E)
- Syntax highlighting colors (strings in green, functions in blue, variables in light blue, comments in gray, keywords in purple)
- Accent colors from popular syntax highlighting themes
- Occasional pops of color for important interactive elements

## Header & Navigation
- The header resembles a code editor tab bar
- "main.portfolio" as the active tab
- Geva Kipper's name displayed as a file title
- A styled subtitle mentioning "// This website is re-designed each day by AI and is thus ever-changing"
- Current job at Google shown as a comment line with syntax highlighting

## Project Sections
Each project displayed as a code function/class with:
- Project name as function name
- Description as commented code
- Links shown as string variables or function parameters
- Technologies used shown as imported modules/libraries at the top
- Screenshots/previews contained within styled "console.log" outputs

## Interactive Elements
- Cursor blink effect in various locations
- Hover effects that reveal more content as if revealing code documentation
- Project boxes expand like code folding/unfolding when clicked
- Syntax highlighting animations that subtly pulse or react to mouse movement
- Mini terminal that slides up from bottom when requested

## Footer & Details
- Status bar with GitHub/LinkedIn/Facebook links styled as git branch indicators
- Stopwatch timer displayed in format common to code editors (counting since 2025-04-23 01:03:43)
- Attribution to the AI creator styled as a code comment
- Line numbers along the left side of all content

## Special Effects
- Occasional typing animation as if someone is actively coding the site
- Syntax error highlighting that appears and resolves itself
- Auto-complete suggestions that pop up when hovering over certain elements
- Console messages that appear with project details when interacted with

## Responsive Behavior
- Collapses into mobile IDE view on smaller screens
- Project sections transform into tabs that can be selected
- Side panel becomes toggleable via a hamburger menu
- Maintains code editor aesthetic at all screen sizes
