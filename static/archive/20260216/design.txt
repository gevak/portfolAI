# Portfolio Website Design: "GevaOS"

## Overall Concept

The entire page presents itself as a retro-modern operating system desktop environment — think a blend between Windows 95's charm and a sleek modern Linux tiling window manager. The background is a deep gradient wallpaper shifting from midnight navy to a muted teal, overlaid with a subtle animated grid of faintly glowing dots that slowly pulse, evoking a circuit board or starfield. The aesthetic is flat-design with pixel-art accents: sharp window borders, monospaced typography mixed with clean sans-serif fonts, and a muted but warm color palette (soft amber, dusty rose, terminal green, slate blue, cream white).

## Top Bar (Taskbar)

A fixed horizontal taskbar sits at the very top of the viewport, styled like a classic OS menu bar. On the left it reads "GevaOS v2025.02" in a small monospaced font. On the right, a tiny real-time clock displays the current time, and beside it a small animated Wi-Fi icon and a battery icon stuck at 100%. The center of the taskbar displays in a gentle typewriter animation: **"⚠ This desktop is redesigned each day by AI — no two visits are ever quite the same."** The text has a subtle shimmer effect, as if the pixels are gently rearranging themselves.

## Desktop Greeting Area

Below the taskbar, centered on the upper portion of the desktop, is a "Welcome" dialog box — a draggable-looking window (though it stays fixed) with a title bar reading "Welcome.exe". Inside, a clean profile section: the name **"Geva Kipper"** rendered large in a bold, slightly rounded sans-serif font (like Inter or DM Sans) with a subtle text-shadow glow in amber. Below it, in a lighter weight: **"Software Engineer at Google, building things that make the web faster."** The window has a small animated pixel-art penguin or robot mascot in the corner, blinking occasionally.

## Desktop Icons & Folder Windows

Scattered naturally across the desktop below the welcome dialog are seven clickable desktop icons arranged in a loose, organic grid — not perfectly aligned, as if someone casually placed them on their desktop. Each icon is a stylized folder or application icon rendered in a chunky pixel-art style with a label underneath in small white monospaced text. When you hover over any icon, it gently bounces and its label highlights in amber.

**Clicking an icon opens a "window"** that slides up and expands from the icon's position with a smooth spring animation. Each window has a classic title bar with a colored close button (red circle), a minimize button (yellow circle), and a maximize button (green circle). The close button actually closes/collapses the window back to its icon. Multiple windows can be open simultaneously and they layer with z-index stacking — clicking a window brings it to front. Each window has a very subtle drop shadow and a thin 1px border in a lighter shade of its accent color.

## Window 1: GlglStats.app (Accent Color: Terminal Green)

The icon is a musical note merged with a bar chart. The window title bar reads "GlglStats — Song Repetition Analyzer". Inside, the left half contains a description: "A Python project measuring the repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression, with visualizations of repetition patterns across famous songs." The text is styled like a terminal readout with a faint green-on-dark aesthetic inside this particular window. The right half embeds the YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo) in a stylized frame that looks like a media player application within the OS, complete with a fake "PyData TLV — Live Recording" label above it. Below the description, two buttons styled as OS action buttons: **"▶ Launch Site"** linking to https://glglstats.geekip.dev and **"🎬 Watch Talk"** linking to the YouTube URL. A decorative element: a small animated waveform visualizer bar runs along the bottom edge of the window.

## Window 2: AhuzatDibuk.app (Accent Color: Dusty Rose / Warm Red)

The icon is a car inside a parking "P" sign. The window title reads "Ahuzat Dibuk — TLV Parking Intelligence". The window interior uses a map-like aesthetic: the background is a faintly visible, blurred stylized map grid. The description reads: "A Python scraping and data visualization project collecting real-time statistics on Tel-Aviv parking lot occupancy, generating heat-maps to help residents find parking." Below the description, a section labeled "📰 In The News" with three styled link cards arranged horizontally, each looking like a tiny newspaper clipping or browser tab: one linking to the Channel 13 news story, one to the Mako article, and one to the Facebook post labeled "Original Post — Secret Tel Aviv." Each link card has a small favicon-style icon (a TV for 13tv, a newspaper for Mako, and the Facebook "f" for the Facebook link) and the domain name shown below the title.

## Window 3: PartOrienting.exe (Accent Color: Slate Blue)

The icon is a geometric polygon with an arrow pushing it. The window title reads "2D Part Orienting — Computational Geometry". Inside, the background has a faint blueprint/graph-paper texture with light blue gridlines. The description: "C++ implementation in an open-source computational geometry library (CGAL) of an efficient algorithm for constructing a 'push plan' to orient a given polygon." A small decorative SVG animation shows a simple polygon being slowly rotated and pushed by a flat edge, looping infinitely — just a subtle geometric animation. A single button: **"📐 View Project & Code"** linking to the TAU CGL page.

## Window 4: TuringJest.app (Accent Color: Warm Amber / Gold)

The icon is a jester's hat with a speech bubble. The window title reads "The Turing Jest — LLM Comedy Arena". Inside, the window is styled like a chat or arena interface mockup. The description: "An LMSYS-style arena where large language models compete at making and explaining puns. Users rate the AI-generated humor to crown the funniest model." A decorative element: two side-by-side speech bubbles, one labeled "Model A" and one "Model B," each containing a sample pun in italic text, with star-rating icons below them — all purely decorative. A button: **"😂 Enter the Arena"** linking to https://jest.geekip.dev.

## Window 5: RhymesOfIsrael.crx (Accent Color: Soft Purple)

The icon is a Chrome browser logo wearing a tiny graduation cap. The window title reads "Rhymes of Israel — Chrome Extension". Inside, the description: "A Chrome extension powered by an LLM that rewrites Israeli news headlines into comedic rhyming couplets in the style of a high school yearbook." A decorative mockup shows a fake news headline ("Prime Minister Visits Northern Border") with an arrow transforming it into a rhyming version in a playful handwritten-style font, displayed on what looks like a torn yearbook page. A button styled as a Chrome Web Store install button: **"➕ Add to Chrome"** linking to the Chrome Web Store URL.

## Window 6: Portfolio.dev (Accent Color: Teal / Cyan)

The icon is a recursive picture-in-picture frame — a monitor displaying a smaller version of itself. The window title reads "This Very Website — How Meta". Inside, the window contains a playful self-referential description: "You're looking at it. This portfolio website, redesigned daily by AI, is itself a project — a self-referencing, ever-evolving experiment in generative web design." The interior has a subtle infinite mirror effect: a small screenshot-like rendering of the desktop itself, slightly tilted and faded, nested inside the window. A button: **"🔄 Reload Reality"** linking to https://geekip.dev.

## Window 7: Socials (System Tray Style — Accent Color: Cream/White)

The icon is a contact-card or address-book icon. The window title reads "Connect — Find Me Online". This window is intentionally smaller and simpler than the others. Inside, three large, evenly spaced social media icons rendered in a clean monochrome line-art style that subtly fills with color on hover (GitHub's octocat fills black, LinkedIn fills its brand blue, Facebook fills its brand blue). Each icon has the handle displayed below it: "gevak", "gevakip", "geva.kipper". The links point to github.com/gevak, linkedin.com/in/gevakip, and facebook.com/geva.kipper respectively. On hover, each icon does a gentle rotation or flip animation.

## Bottom Dock / Footer

At the very bottom of the page, a frosted-glass style dock bar (reminiscent of macOS) sits fixed. In the center of this dock, small text reads: **"Designed by Claude (Anthropic) · An AI-generated experience"** — styled humbly in a small, light font. To the right of this credit, a live stopwatch counts upward, labeled **"Time since creation:"** and displaying hours, minutes, and seconds elapsed since February 16, 2026, 01:28:27 UTC. The stopwatch digits use a monospaced digital-clock font and have a faint glow effect in amber, ticking every second via JavaScript.

## Interactions & Polish

All windows start in a closed/minimized state so the user first sees the desktop with scattered icons and the welcome dialog. Clicking an icon opens its window with a satisfying spring animation (CSS transitions with slight overshoot). The desktop icons can optionally have a very subtle parallax drift when the mouse moves across the page, giving a sense of depth. The entire page uses smooth scrolling if the content exceeds viewport height on smaller screens. On mobile, the layout adapts: the desktop icons stack into a vertical scrollable list, and tapping one expands its content inline accordion-style rather than as floating windows, since draggable windows don't suit touch interfaces. The color scheme respects `prefers-color-scheme`: the dark theme described above is default, but a light mode inverts to a creamy off-white desktop with pastel window accents and darker text if the user's system is set to light mode. A tiny theme toggle icon (sun/moon) in the taskbar allows manual switching.
