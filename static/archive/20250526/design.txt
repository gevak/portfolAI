The website opens as a full-screen code editor interface with a dark theme reminiscent of VS Code or Sublime Text. The main viewport is structured as a tabbed editor environment where each tab represents a different section of the portfolio. The active tab glows with subtle syntax highlighting colors (blues, greens, and oranges) while inactive tabs remain dimmed.

The header contains a file explorer sidebar on the left (collapsed by default) and the main editor area occupying the center. At the top, traditional editor tabs display: "about.js", "glglstats.py", "parking.py", "geometry.cpp", "portfolio.html", and "contact.md". The active tab shows a blinking cursor and syntax-highlighted content that actually represents the portfolio information formatted as commented code.

Each section renders as authentic code with appropriate syntax highlighting for its file type. The GlglStats section appears as Python code with docstrings explaining the project, embedded links styled as import statements, and the video link formatted as a function call. The Ahuzat Dibuk section follows similar Python formatting with news links appearing as URL constants and comments describing the heat-map functionality.

The geometry project displays as C++ code with proper syntax coloring, including header includes and function signatures that metaphorically represent the algorithm's functionality. The meta portfolio section renders as HTML with CSS classes and JavaScript functions, creating a playful recursive reference within the code editor theme.

A status bar at the bottom mimics a real code editor, showing file information, line/column numbers that change as you scroll, and the live stopwatch displaying elapsed time since the specified date. The AI credit appears as a comment in the status bar, styled like a version control attribution.

Smooth transitions occur when switching between tabs, with a typing animation effect that makes content appear as if being coded in real-time. Subtle background patterns suggest a terminal or command line environment, while maintaining readability and professional aesthetics throughout the interface.
