Upon loading, the page presents a full-screen, minimalist, and interactive subway map against a slightly textured, dark charcoal grey background, reminiscent of slate. The entire portfolio is this single, explorable map. There is no traditional scrolling; the user interacts by panning and clicking on the map elements.

At the top left of the screen, fixed in place, is the primary text in a clean, white, sans-serif font. The main header reads **Geva Kipper**, and directly beneath it, in a slightly smaller font, "Currently building the future of search at Google." Below this, a smaller, italicized, and subtly glowing line of text states: *This site's design is regenerated daily by an AI, its layout is ever-changing.*

The core of the page is the subway map itself. There are four main "lines," each a different vibrant, neon-like color that pops against the dark background: Python/Data (Electric Blue), LLM/AI (Vivid Magenta), Core CS/Web (Luminous Green), and Social/Contact (Bright Orange). The lines are drawn with smooth curves, weaving across the screen to connect various "stations."

Each project is a "station" on the map, represented by a glowing circle on its respective line. The project's name is written next to its station marker in a clear, legible font.
*   The **Electric Blue Line** (Python/Data) features two stations: **'GlglStats'** and **'Ahuzat Dibuk'**.
*   The **Vivid Magenta Line** (LLM/AI) has stations for **'The Turing Jest'** and **'Rhymes of Israel'**.
*   The **Luminous Green Line** (Core CS/Web) connects **'2D Part Orienting'** and the meta **'Portfolio Website'**. Since 'The Turing Jest' and 'GlglStats' also have web components, they are designed as "interchange stations," where the Green line intersects with the Magenta and Blue lines respectively.

When a user hovers over a station, its name and circular marker pulse with a brighter glow, and the corresponding line subtly brightens along its entire length. Clicking on a station causes the map to smoothly zoom in and center on that station, while a sleek, semi-transparent black information card slides in from the right side of the screen. This card contains the project description. Below the description, a section titled "Connections" displays the associated links. Each link is represented by a clean icon and text: a globe icon for project sites, a YouTube icon for the video, newspaper icons for news articles, a Facebook icon for the post, and a code icon for the source code. Clicking the "X" on the card or clicking anywhere on the map outside the card causes it to slide away and the map to zoom back out to its default view.

The seventh box is not a box at all, but the map's central hub. The **Bright Orange Line** is a circular loop in the center of the map labeled **"Central Station"**. All other lines (Blue, Magenta, and Green) connect to this hub. Clicking on the "Central Station" brings up its own information card, titled "Connect," with three "Outgoing Lines": GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook, each with its respective logo and a direct link.

At the very bottom of the page, a thin, fixed footer bar is present. On the left side, it reads in a small, discreet font: "Design by a generative AI model." On the right side is a live-updating stopwatch with a digital, monospaced font, displaying the H:M:S elapsed since 2025-09-11 01:03:19, under the label "Current Design Age."
