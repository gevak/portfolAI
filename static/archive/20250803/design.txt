The website opens not on a blank page, but into the middle of a scene: a panoramic view of a dimly lit laboratory. The background is a dark, textured wall of riveted metal plates or dark concrete, with subtle, slow-moving smoke or steam effects. The main content area is a long, continuous laboratory bench that the user scrolls through horizontally or vertically. The color palette is dominated by dark greys, deep teals, and brass/copper accents, with vibrant, glowing neons (electric blue, toxic green, amber orange) emanating from the "experiments" themselves to draw the eye. The typography pairs a clean, modern sans-serif for descriptions with a stylized, semi-distressed typewriter or hand-scrawled font for titles and labels, as if they are notes on a schematic.

Upon landing, the top of the page is dominated by the developer's identity, presented as an engraved brass plaque bolted to the lab wall: **Geva Kipper**. Below it, on a flickering, old-fashioned green-text CRT monitor, is the sentence: *Currently brewing code and concocting solutions at Google.* Just beneath this, a line of text glitches into view, as if being typed by an unseen force, declaring: *WARNING: This laboratory's design is reconstituted daily by an experimental AI. Structural and aesthetic anomalies are expected.* This provides the core context for the site's unique premise. The user is then invited to scroll down to inspect the active experiments on the bench.

Each of the six projects is presented as a distinct, interactive "containment unit" or experimental apparatus on the lab bench. On mouse-over, each unit hums to life with animations and sound effects.

1.  **GlglStats:** This experiment is a large glass beaker filled with a clear liquid. Inside, an animated sound-wave, like an oscilloscope reading, pulses gently. Hovering over it causes the liquid to bubble and the wave to become more erratic, visualizing the "repetition." Two glowing buttons are on its control panel. One, labeled "View Analysis," links to the project site. The other, labeled "Archived Lecture Footage," is a small, round screen that, when clicked, opens the YouTube video in a modal overlay.

2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk:** This apparatus is a shallow, horizontal glass tank containing a miniature, 3D-printed topographical map of Tel-Aviv. On hover, a glowing red liquid seeps through the streets on the map, simulating the heat-map data. Next to the tank sits a clipboard with what appear to be singed newspaper clippings and a printed-out social media post attached. These clippings are the links to the news stories and the Facebook publication.

3.  **2D Part Orienting:** This station features a complex mechanical arm with gears and pistons, positioned over a flat, metallic plate. A glowing, geometric polygon shape hovers just above the plate. When the user hovers, the arm begins to move, projecting faint blue lines (the "push plan") onto the plate and nudging the polygon, demonstrating its purpose. A metal tag riveted to the machine's base, labeled "Technical Schematics & Source," contains the link to the CGL project page.

4.  **The Turing Jest:** Presented as two interconnected glass jars, each containing a sparkling, stylized brain that emits faint electrical pulses. A Jacob's Ladder between them arcs with electricity. Hovering causes funny, nonsensical pun fragments to appear in speech bubbles above the jars. The main link to the site is a large, satisfying, clickable red lever on the console labeled "Initiate Jest Protocol."

5.  **Rhymes of Israel:** An antique, steam-powered typewriter sits on the bench. A continuous roll of paper feeds through it, on which rhyming headlines are being actively typed out. The Chrome Web Store icon is subtly integrated as a custom key on the typewriter. The installation link is the paper itself; clicking the text being typed out triggers the link.

6.  **Portfolio Schematics (The Meta Project):** This final project station is a cleared space on the bench with a set of rolled-out blueprints. The blueprints are a wireframe diagram of the very website the user is currently viewing. A drafting lamp above it flickers on when hovered over. The link to `geekip.dev` is a circular "APPROVED" stamp on the blueprint that the user can click.

At the end of the lab bench is the final section: a "Communications & External Links" panel. The links to GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook are not text but three vintage-style vacuum tubes or sockets, each etched with the corresponding logo. When hovered, they glow brightly, and a click produces a satisfying "plug-in" sound effect. Below this final panel, at the very bottom of the page, is a small, bolted-on metal plate with stamped text: *Site Architecture Conceived by Assistant AI: GPT-4.* Next to it is a digital counter with a retro Nixie tube display, showing a live stopwatch of the hours, minutes, and seconds that have elapsed since `2025-08-03 01:20:32`, reinforcing the idea of an ongoing, ever-evolving experiment.
