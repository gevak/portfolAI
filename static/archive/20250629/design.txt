### Portfolio Design: "The AI's Daily Sketchbook"

**Overall Concept:** The website appears as a single, vertically scrolling page from a high-quality Moleskine-style digital notebook. The background is a very subtle, off-white textured paper. All elements on the page look like they've been hand-drawn, sketched, or written directly onto the paper. The layout is asymmetrical and organic, as if someone arranged notes and sketches on a single large sheet. On each page load, a script will slightly adjust the rotation (±1-2 degrees) and position (±5-10 pixels) of each content cluster, making the subtitle "re-designed each day" a functional reality.

**Header Section:**

At the top left of the page, the name **Geva Kipper** is written in a bold, legible, and stylish handwritten font. Directly below it, in a clean, smaller, sans-serif font (as if typed and pasted in), is the sentence: "Developing innovative tools for creators at Google."

To the right of the name and slightly below it, a note is jotted down in a lighter, quicker handwritten script, circled by a hand-drawn, slightly imperfect circle: *"This digital notebook is procedurally re-sketched by an AI model each day, so its layout is always a little different."* A doodled, dashed arrow leads from this note towards the first project section.

**Content Sections (The Five "Boxes"):**

These are not literal boxes but distinct clusters of text, sketches, and interactive elements, arranged in a staggered, non-linear fashion down the page.

1.  **GlglStats:**
    *   The title "GlglStats" is written in the main handwritten font, underlined with a wavy, hand-drawn line mimicking a sound wave.
    *   The description is written in a neat, small, handwritten script.
    *   A simple, animated SVG sketch of an LZ77 compression tree or a bar chart is doodled next to the text.
    *   The links are presented as two separate elements:
        *   A hand-drawn button with the text "Visit the Site" inside. On hover, the button's border jitters slightly.
        *   A polaroid-style image that is actually an embedded video player for the YouTube talk. The polaroid is "taped" to the page with a piece of digital washi tape. Clicking it opens the video in a lightbox.

2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk:**
    *   The title "Ahuzat Dibuk" is sketched, and beside it is a small, hand-drawn doodle of a car looking for a parking spot.
    *   The description is presented as a block of handwritten text.
    *   A simplified, hand-drawn map of Tel-Aviv with splotches of color (reds, yellows, greens) is sketched to represent the heatmap concept.
    *   The three links are listed under a small, handwritten heading: "As seen in...". Each link is annotated with a small icon: a newspaper icon for the news sites and a Facebook 'f' icon. The text for the links appears to be written in blue ink.

3.  **2D Part Orienting:**
    *   The title "2D Part Orienting" sits beside a key visual: a looping SVG animation. The animation shows a complex, hand-drawn polygon. Little, hand-drawn arrows appear sequentially, "pushing" the polygon, causing it to rotate and shift until it settles into its final, oriented position. The animation repeats slowly.
    *   The project description is presented as a "technical note" inside a hand-drawn box with a tab labeled "CGL / C++".
    *   The link to the code and info is styled to look like a code comment: `// view project details & code`.

4.  **This Portfolio:**
    *   This section is smaller and more playful. The title is "This very Notebook".
    *   The description is short: "A meta-project about projects. Sketched with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a dash of self-awareness."
    *   A large, hand-drawn, looping arrow starts from this cluster and points back towards the main "Geva Kipper" title at the top of the page.
    *   The self-referential link is simply the word `(refresh)` written in the handwritten font, which reloads the page to demonstrate the changing layout.

5.  **Connect:**
    *   This is not a cluster but a series of icons at the bottom right of the main content area, before the footer.
    *   There is no title. It just contains three large, beautifully hand-drawn and detailed icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook.
    *   On hover, the icons fill with a very light, translucent color, and a small handwritten tooltip with the site's name appears above them.

**Footer:**

A thin, wobbly, hand-drawn horizontal line separates the main content from the footer. The footer has two elements on opposite sides:

*   **Left Side:** In a tiny, clean, sans-serif font: "Page designed and sketched by a generative AI model."
*   **Right Side:** A label in the same tiny font reads: "Time since last manual commit:". Beside it is the live stopwatch. The numbers for hours, minutes, and seconds are displayed in a classic, crisp, monospace digital font, creating a stark, interesting contrast with the hand-drawn aesthetic of the rest of the site.
