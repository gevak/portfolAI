### Website Design: The Kipper Belt

**Overall Concept & Initial View:**

The website is a single-page, immersive journey through a minimalist, interactive galaxy. The background is a very dark, deep space blue, with a subtle, slow-drifting nebula effect created with CSS gradients. A field of tiny, faintly twinkling stars adds depth, reacting with a gentle parallax effect to the user's mouse movement, creating a sense of three-dimensional space.

Upon loading, the user is greeted by the central element: a bright, serene, slowly pulsating white star. Integrated within its soft glow is the developer's name, **Geva Kipper**, in a clean, elegant sans-serif font. Directly below the star, his role is stated: "Currently crafting software at Google." Just beneath this, a smaller, ethereal subtitle fades in: "This portfolio is re-designed each day by AI, creating an ever-changing celestial map."

Orbiting this central star are five distinct celestial bodies, each representing a project or section. These are not static icons but dynamic, slowly rotating objects with faint, glowing orbital paths. The user can navigate by moving their mouse, which acts as a viewpoint, or by clicking directly on a celestial body to zoom in.

**Project & Section Interaction:**

Hovering over any of the five celestial bodies causes its orbital path to glow brighter and a simple, clean label with the project's name to appear beside it.

Clicking on a body triggers a smooth, swift zoom animation. The rest of the galaxy blurs and recedes into the background as the view focuses on the selected object. The object then elegantly transforms into a sleek, semi-transparent information panel that appears to be projected in space. This panel has a dark, frosted-glass effect and a thin, glowing border matching the "planet's" color. A celestial-themed "X" icon in the top right corner allows the user to close the panel, triggering a smooth zoom-out animation back to the main galaxy view.

Here is the design for each celestial body and its corresponding information panel:

1.  **GlglStats (A Sonic Planet):** This planet is a vibrant sphere with glowing, sound-wave-like rings rotating around it, similar to Saturn. Upon clicking, the info panel displays "GlglStats" as the title. The description of the project is on the left. On the right, there is a large, embedded YouTube frame for the conference presentation. Below it is a glowing button labeled "Explore the Data" that links to the GlglStats website.

2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk (A Geo-Data Planet):** This planet resembles a "city-planet" at night, its surface covered in a faint grid with pulsating patches of orange and red, mimicking a heat-map. When clicked, the info panel shows the project title and description. To the right, instead of a single video, there are three stylized buttons. Two buttons feature the logos of the news outlets (13tv and Mako) and link to the articles. The third features a Facebook logo and links to the original post. The buttons glow on hover.

3.  **2D Part Orienting (A Crystalline Planet):** This planet is a slowly rotating, low-poly crystalline structure that catches and refracts the light from the central star. Its facets shimmer with geometric patterns. The clicked information panel presents the project title and C++ details on the left. On the right, a single, prominent button designed to look like a piece of the crystal is labeled "View Algorithm & Code" and links to the project page.

4.  **The Portfolio (A Meta Dyson Swarm):** This celestial body is a fascinating constructâ€”not a solid planet, but a swarm of small, metallic-looking objects orbiting a central point of light, like an unfinished Dyson sphere. Glimpses of what looks like glowing code can be seen arcing between the pieces. The information panel it reveals is self-referential, explaining the portfolio project itself. A button stylized as a swirling wormhole is labeled "Reload the Universe" and links to the portfolio's own URL.

5.  **Contact & Social Links (An Asteroid Belt):** This is not a single planet but a small, dense asteroid belt C-clamped around the main star, further out than the projects. Three larger, more prominent asteroids gently tumble within the belt. Hovering over the belt reveals the title "Connect." Clicking on any of the three main asteroids doesn't open a large panel, but instead instantly opens the corresponding link (GitHub, LinkedIn, Facebook) in a new tab. Each asteroid has a simple, etched icon representing the platform that glows when the mouse is near.

**Footer & Final Details:**

A thin, static footer remains fixed at the very bottom of the screen, unobtrusive and styled with a small, clean font. On the left, it reads: "Cosmic design by a generative AI model." On the right, a live stopwatch displays the time elapsed since 2025-07-01 01:17:22, labeled "Time Since Genesis: [HH:MM:SS]". The entire experience is fluid, with seamless transitions, designed to be both a functional portfolio and a small piece of interactive art.
