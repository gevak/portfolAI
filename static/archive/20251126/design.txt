# Thanksgiving Feast Portfolio Design for Geva Kipper

## Overall Concept & Layout

The page presents an overhead view of a warm, rustic wooden dining table stretching vertically down the single-page scroll. The wood grain texture is rich walnut with subtle knots and natural variations. A cream-colored linen table runner flows down the center. Scattered around the edges are autumn leaves in burnt orange, deep red, and golden yellow that gently drift with subtle CSS animations. Soft candlelight glows from illustrated taper candles in brass holders placed intermittently along the table, creating warm ambient lighting with flickering shadow effects.

## Header Section

At the top of the table sits an ornate ceramic plate with a gold rim, functioning as the hero area. Inside the plate, elegant handwritten-style typography displays "Geva Kipper" in a warm brown ink color. Below the name, written as if on a small folded place card propped against the plate: "Currently crafting developer experiences at Google." Above this main plate, a small decorative card pinned with an illustrated autumn leaf reads in delicate italic: "This table is reset and redesigned daily by AI — no two visits taste quite the same."

## Project Sections as Dishes

The six project boxes are styled as various Thanksgiving serving dishes arranged naturally along the table, alternating left and right of the center runner:

**1. GlglStats (Large Oval Turkey Platter)**
A grand copper-rimmed oval serving platter dominates the upper left. The "turkey" is illustrated as a stylized waveform/audio visualization in warm browns and oranges, representing the song analysis. Steam rises from it with a gentle floating animation. The project title appears on a small recipe card tucked under the platter edge. Description text appears on an unfolded parchment-style recipe beneath, listing "ingredients" like Python, LZ77, and data visualization. The YouTube video embeds as a small polaroid-style frame leaning against the platter. The site link appears as a handwritten addition at the bottom of the recipe card.

**2. Ahuzat Dibuk (Casserole Dish)**
A deep amber-colored ceramic casserole dish with a lid slightly ajar on the right side. Inside, a miniature illustrated heat map representing Tel Aviv parking data, colored in gradient from green through yellow to red like a bubbling dish. The news links appear as newspaper clippings scattered beneath the dish, slightly overlapping, with real masthead snippets (13tv, Mako). The Facebook link displays as a small blue-tinted Polaroid photo.

**3. 2D Part Orienting (Geometric Pie)**
A pie dish containing a pie with an intricate lattice top, but the lattice forms geometric polygon shapes and computational geometry patterns. The crust edges show C++ syntax highlighting colors subtly. A pie server rests alongside with the TAU project link engraved on its handle.

**4. The Turing Jest (Gravy Boat)**
An elegant silver gravy boat with steam rising in the shape of speech bubbles. The gravy inside shimmers between two colors, representing competing LLMs. Small jester hat icons float in the steam. A small tent card beside it shows the jest.geekip.dev link styled as a menu item.

**5. Rhymes of Israel (Bread Basket)**
A woven basket with a checkered cloth napkin, containing bread rolls. Each roll has tiny text etched on top showing rhyming words in Hebrew/English. A small Chrome logo appears as a decorative bread clip. The extension link appears on a small tag tied to the basket handle with twine.

**6. Meta Portfolio (Dessert Stand)**
A tiered dessert stand displaying a small fondant replica of this very webpage as a tiny decorated cake. It creates an infinite regression visual if you look closely. The geekip.dev link appears on a small flag toothpick stuck in the top tier.

## Social Links Section

**7. Coffee & Connections (Bottom of Table)**
Three steaming coffee mugs arranged in a cozy cluster near the table's bottom edge. Each mug has a different design: the GitHub mug is dark with the Octocat subtly embossed, the LinkedIn mug is cream-colored with blue interior visible, and the Facebook mug has a warm terracotta tone. Steam from each mug forms the respective platform icons as it rises. Beneath the mugs, three coasters display the actual links.

## Footer

A small brass plaque screwed into the wooden table edge at the very bottom, tarnished and elegant, reads: "Table set by Claude (Anthropic) — a feast of code and creativity." Below it, an antique pocket watch illustration lies open on the table surface, its hands moving in real-time, with a small digital readout beneath showing elapsed time since November 26, 2025, 01:06:28 in elegant serif numerals formatted as "XX hours, XX minutes, XX seconds since the first serving."

## Interactive Elements & Animations

Hovering over any dish causes gentle steam to increase, a warm glow to emanate from beneath, and the dish to rise slightly as if being lifted for serving. Cursor changes to a serving spoon icon when over project cards. Parallax scrolling makes the scattered leaves and candle flames move at different rates. The table runner has a subtle embroidered pattern that reveals itself on scroll. Clicking sounds mimic ceramic dishes clinking softly.

## Color Palette

Deep walnut brown (#5D4037), warm cream (#FFF8E7), burnt orange (#D84315), harvest gold (#FFB300), cranberry red (#B71C1C), sage green (#8BC34A for accents), and candlelight yellow (#FFECB3) for glowing elements.

## Typography

Headers use a warm serif like Playfair Display, body text uses a clean Lora, and handwritten elements use a script like Caveat or Satisfy. Recipe card text uses a typewriter-style font like Special Elite.
