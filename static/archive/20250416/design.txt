Okay, here is the design description for the interactive subway map portfolio:

**Overall Concept:**
The website is a single, full-screen page dominated by a stylized, interactive subway map. The background is a clean, neutral color (e.g., off-white, very light grey). The map itself uses a limited, sophisticated color palette with distinct colors for each "line." Lines are rendered with smooth curves and clear connections, representing pathways between Geva's skills and experiences. Key projects, skills, and contact points are represented as "stations" on these lines. The overall aesthetic is minimalist, utilizing sharp typography (sans-serif) and subtle animations.

**Header Section:**
Positioned subtly at the top left or centered is the name "Geva Kipper" in a clear, modern font. Directly below it, in a slightly smaller font size, is the sentence describing his current work at Google. Below this, a distinct subtitle reads: "This site's design is regenerated daily by AI â€“ always a work in progress." This subtitle might have a subtle visual treatment, like a slightly different font weight or a faint background highlight, to draw attention to its unique nature.

**Interactive Map & Content Display:**
The subway map forms the main visual element. It features several interconnected lines (e.g., a "Python/Data" line, a "C++/Algorithms" line, a "Web/Meta" line, and a "Connect" line).

*   **Stations:** Five key areas are marked as distinct stations on the map, perhaps represented by clean circles or rounded squares containing simple icons or just text labels ("GlglStats", "Ahuzat Dibuk", "Part Orienting", "Portfolio", "Connect"). Hovering over a station causes it to subtly pulse or enlarge, and its corresponding line might brighten slightly.
*   **Interaction:** Clicking a station triggers a smooth animation. The map might subtly zoom/pan to focus on the clicked station, while simultaneously, a clean, semi-transparent overlay panel slides in from the right (or left) side of the screen. This panel occupies roughly one-third to one-half of the screen width, allowing the map to remain partially visible.
*   **Content Panels:** Each panel corresponds to one of the five requested boxes:
    1.  **GlglStats Panel:** Displays the project title "GlglStats," the description (Python, LZ77, music repetition, visualization), a clear button/link labeled "Visit Site" pointing to `https://glglstats.onrender.com/`, and an embedded YouTube player or a thumbnail link labeled "Watch PyData Talk" pointing to `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo`.
    2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk Panel:** Displays the title "Ahuzat Dibuk," the description (Python, scraping, parking data viz, heatmaps), and clearly labeled links: "News Story (Channel 13)" to `https://13tv.co.il/...`, "News Story (Mako)" to `https://www.mako.co.il/...`, and "Original Facebook Post" to `https://www.facebook.com/groups/...`. Perhaps include a small, static heatmap graphic example.
    3.  **2D Part Orienting Panel:** Displays the title "2D Part Orienting," the description (C++, CGAL, algorithm implementation), and a link labeled "Info & Code" pointing to `https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/...`. Maybe include a simple geometric diagram related to the project.
    4.  **Portfolio Panel:** Displays the title "Portfolio Project (Meta)," a brief description acknowledging the self-referential nature (e.g., "The interactive subway map site you're currently viewing."), and a link labeled "View Source (Conceptual)" or simply the site's URL: `https://portfolio-dor1.onrender.com/`.
    5.  **Connect Panel:** This panel contains icons and links for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook, using their respective logos. Links point to `github.com/gevak`, `linkedin.com/in/gevakip`, and `facebook.com/geva.kipper`. Labels like "GitHub Profile," "LinkedIn Profile," "Facebook Profile" accompany the icons/links.

*   **Closing Panels:** Each panel has a clear 'X' icon in the top corner to close it, smoothly sliding it back out and returning the map to its default state.

**Footer Section:**
Located at the very bottom of the page, centered or aligned to the right, is a small text line: "Site design generated by AI assistant." Directly below or beside this, a dynamic stopwatch displays the elapsed time since 2025-04-16 01:03:50, constantly updating in HH:MM:SS format. The font size here is small and unobtrusive.
