The website's entire viewport is a static, high-fidelity rendering of a classic grey Game Boy. The content is exclusively displayed within the device's screen area, which features a greenish-yellow, dot-matrix pixel grid effect. Upon loading, the site executes a classic boot-up sequence: a black bar descends from the top of the screen, revealing the name "Geva Kipper" in a pixelated font, accompanied by a single "ping" sound effect. Immediately following, the subtitle "This website is re-designed each day by AI and is thus ever-changing" scrolls up from the bottom of the screen before fading. The D-pad, A, B, Start, and Select buttons on the Game Boy shell are all interactive.

The primary navigation is handled through the D-pad (and corresponding keyboard arrow keys). The main screen presents a vertical menu with five selectable options. A small animated arrow `>` points to the currently selected item, and moving the D-pad up or down moves the arrow. The A button functions as "Select," and the B button as "Back." The Start button opens a small, unobtrusive pop-up window within the game screen that displays: "Geva Kipper | Software Engineer at Google." Pressing Start again, or the B button, closes this window.

The five menu items are presented in a clean, 8-bit font. When an item is highlighted by the navigation arrow, a small, pixelated icon animates into view next to it.
1.  **GLGLSTATS**: The icon is a pixelated musical note and a graph line.
2.  **AHUZAT DIBUK**: The icon is a pixelated car in a parking space.
3.  **2D PART ORIENTING**: The icon is an abstract rotating polygon.
4.  **META PORTFOLIO**: The icon is a pixelated Game Boy.
5.  **CONNECT**: The icon is a pixelated chain link.

Pressing the A button on a project transitions the screen to a dedicated detail view for that item. This transition is a quick fade-to-black and fade-in. Each detail screen displays a title, a brief description, and a sub-menu of interactive links, all in the same pixelated style. For example, selecting "GLGLSTATS" shows its description, followed by selectable links for "Project Website" and "Watch Conference Talk." Selecting a link with the A button opens it in a new browser tab. The "CONNECT" menu item leads to a similar screen with three selectable links for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Pressing the B button at any point returns the user to the main menu screen with a simple wipe transition.

The aesthetic is strictly minimalistic and retro. The color palette within the screen is limited to the four shades of the original Game Boy (from near-black to a pale greenish-yellow). All animations are crisp and non-eased, mimicking the hardware limitations of the era. The Game Boy shell itself has subtle hover and click effects; for instance, a button visually depresses when clicked.

At the very bottom of the game screen, serving as a persistent footer below the main menu, are two lines of text in the smallest legible pixel font. The first line reads: "AI Design & Concept: [Model Name]". The second line is a live stopwatch labeled "System Uptime:" which actively counts the hours, minutes, and seconds that have passed since the timestamp 2025-06-10 01:10:05, adding a dynamic, modern element to the retro interface.
