**Interactive Code Playground Portfolio Design**

The page opens with a dark, terminal-inspired background (#1a1a2e) featuring subtle animated binary code patterns that slowly cascade down like digital rain. At the top, "Geva Kipper" appears in a bold, monospace font with a subtle neon green glow effect, followed by his Google work description in smaller text. Beneath this, an italic subtitle in amber text explains the AI-redesigned nature of the site, with a small "refresh" icon that pulses gently.

The five project sections are arranged as interactive code editor windows, each resembling a miniature IDE interface complete with syntax highlighting, line numbers, and collapsible panels. Each "window" has a realistic titlebar with colored dots (red, yellow, green) and displays pseudo-code relevant to the project's functionality. When visitors hover over any section, the code becomes live and editable in a small embedded Monaco Editor instance, allowing them to modify simple examples related to each project (compression algorithms for GlglStats, data parsing for Ahuzat Dibuk, geometric calculations for 2D Part Orienting, HTML/CSS for the portfolio project, and API calls for the social links).

The GlglStats section displays animated compression visualization with bars that compress and expand, while the Ahuzat Dibuk section shows a mini heat-map that updates in real-time. The 2D Part Orienting window features an interactive polygon that visitors can click to see orientation animations. The portfolio section contains a recursive iframe effect that creates an infinite mirror illusion. The social links section presents the profiles as terminal commands (git clone, curl LinkedIn, ping Facebook) that visitors can "execute" by clicking.

At the bottom, a sleek footer credits the AI designer with a typing animation effect, alongside a prominent digital stopwatch displaying the elapsed time since the specified date in a retro LCD font style. The entire page uses smooth transitions and subtle parallax scrolling effects, creating an immersive coding environment that feels both professional and playfully interactive.
