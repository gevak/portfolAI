# Interactive Keyboard Heatmap Portfolio Design Concept

## Overall Theme
A minimalist dark-themed portfolio centered around an interactive keyboard visualization. The keyboard appears as the hero element—a stylized mechanical keyboard with keys that light up in different colors representing programming languages used (Python glows blue, C++ glows orange, JavaScript glows yellow, etc.). The intensity of each key's glow indicates frequency of use.

## Header
Geva Kipper's name appears in a clean, monospace font at the top left, followed by a subtle subtitle stating "Software Engineer at Google, crafting tools that transform data into insights." On the top right, a small annotation in italics: "This website re-designs itself daily using AI—what you see today is unique."

## Keyboard Focus Area
The keyboard visualization sits prominently below the header. When visitors hover over a key, a small tooltip appears showing what that key is commonly used for in coding. Clicking any key triggers a small, satisfying "key press" animation and sound. The space bar, when clicked, toggles between different time periods (last week, last month, last year) changing the heatmap intensity.

## Project Showcase
Below the keyboard, five uniformly sized, semi-transparent glass-morphic cards arranged in a staggered grid:

1. **GlglStats Card**: Features a sound wave visualization pulsing gently. Contains brief project description and links clearly marked with icons (website link, conference video).

2. **Ahuzat Dibuk Card**: Displays a mini-heatmap of Tel Aviv that shifts colors subtly. News story links appear as media outlet logos.

3. **2D Part Orienting Card**: Shows an animated polygon rotated by invisible forces. Link to the project page with code repository appears as a stylized geometric shape.

4. **Portfolio Website Card**: Meta reference with a "recursion" visual element - an infinite mirror effect with multiple smaller versions of the current site fading into the background.

5. **Social Links Card**: Contains three hoverable icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook that glow and enlarge slightly when interacted with.

## Interactive Elements
- As users scroll down, the keyboard transitions to a fixed, miniature version in the corner
- Each project card has a subtle hover state that raises it slightly and increases brightness
- Clicking any project expands its card with additional details without leaving the page

## Footer
A minimalist footer with attribution to the AI model that designed today's iteration, paired with an elegant ticking stopwatch displaying time elapsed since April 21, 2025, 01:06:28 in a monospace font.

## Technical Aesthetics
The overall color scheme uses a dark background with high-contrast text and vibrant accent colors that match the keyboard heatmap. Typography follows a coding theme with monospace headers and sans-serif body text. All animations are smooth and subtle, enhancing rather than distracting from the content.
