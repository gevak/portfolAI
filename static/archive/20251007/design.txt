# Terminal Portfolio - Design Specification

## Visual Concept & Layout

The entire viewport displays a full-screen terminal emulator with a dark charcoal background (#1a1a1a) and phosphor green text (#00ff41) as the primary color scheme, evoking classic CRT monitors. A subtle scanline animation overlay moves vertically across the screen, and a very faint CRT curvature effect applies to the edges of the viewport for authenticity. The terminal has a thin border with rounded corners and a subtle glow effect.

At the top-left, a terminal header bar shows "geva@portfolio:~$" in a monospace font (Fira Code or JetBrains Mono), with traditional terminal window controls (close, minimize, maximize) that are purely decorative. Below this, an animated typing effect introduces the user: "root@geekip.dev ~ % whoami" followed by the response "Geva Kipper - Software Engineer @ Google, working on making search smarter." This appears character-by-character as if being typed in real-time with a blinking cursor.

Directly beneath, a second command auto-types: "cat ./README.md" which reveals the subtitle in dimmed cyan text (#00d9ff): "*Note: This portfolio is re-designed daily by AI - every visit offers a new experience.*"

## Navigation & Interaction Model

A command prompt sits persistently at the bottom of the screen: "geva@portfolio:~$ _" with a blinking cursor. Users can type commands like "ls" to list all projects, "cd [project-name]" to focus on a specific section, "help" for available commands, or "clear" to reset the view. However, the interface also responds to traditional scrolling and clicking for accessibility.

Above the command prompt, the six project boxes are arranged in a 2x3 grid (3x2 on mobile), each styled as a terminal window pane with ASCII art borders using characters like ┌─┐│└┘. Each box has a colored accent line on the left edge - different muted terminal colors: yellow (#ffcc00), magenta (#ff00ff), cyan (#00d9ff), blue (#0099ff), red (#ff4444), and green (#00ff41).

## Project Box Design

Each project box begins with an ASCII art icon representing the project theme:
- **GlglStats**: Musical notes made from ASCII characters with wave patterns
- **Ahuzat Dibuk**: A grid representing a parking lot with P symbols
- **2D Part Orienting**: Geometric shapes constructed from slashes and dashes
- **The Turing Jest**: A laughing face emoticon made from punctuation
- **Rhymes of Israel**: A scroll or newspaper made from ASCII art
- **Portfolio Meta**: A recursive terminal-within-terminal pattern
- **Social Links**: Connected nodes diagram in ASCII

Below each icon, the project title appears in bold green with a ">" prefix, followed by a single-line description in white. Interactive elements (links, videos) are styled as underlined cyan text with a "[LINK]" or "[VIDEO]" prefix, mimicking clickable terminal links. Hovering over links triggers a subtle background highlight in a semi-transparent green (#00ff4133) with a soft glow.

For the GlglStats video link, clicking opens a modal styled as a maximized terminal window showing the embedded YouTube player. The Ahuzat Dibuk section displays all three news links as a numbered list (1., 2., 3.) in classic terminal output style.

## Social Links Section

The seventh box presents social links as output from a "cat ./contacts" command. Each platform appears with its ASCII logo: GitHub's octocat simplified, LinkedIn's "in" symbol, and Facebook's "f", all constructed from characters. Links are formatted as: "→ [PLATFORM] github.com/gevak" with appropriate URLs.

## Footer Credits

At the absolute bottom, a dimmed gray text (#666666) displays: "System initialized by Claude (Anthropic) | AI-Generated Design v2025" on the left. On the right, a live-updating counter shows: "Uptime: [X]h [Y]m [Z]s since Oct 7, 2025 01:02:18" in the same gray, updating every second with a subtle flicker animation to mimic terminal cursor blinks.

## Interactive Effects

When users type valid commands, there's a brief "processing" animation with a spinning ASCII loader (/, -, \, |). Invalid commands return "command not found: [input]" in red. Hovering over any project box triggers a subtle brighten effect and increases the border glow intensity. The entire page supports keyboard navigation with tab-focusing through interactive elements, each showing a highlighted border when selected.

A "tree" command displays all projects as a hierarchical ASCII tree structure, while "cat [project-name]" expands that specific project to full-screen view with more detailed information appearing as terminal output.
