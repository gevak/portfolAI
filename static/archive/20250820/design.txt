The website opens as a full-screen **dark-themed code editor interface**, styled to look like a modern IDE such as VSCode or Sublime Text. The window has a faux title bar with rounded traffic-light buttons (close/minimize/maximize), and a sidebar file-tree labeled with playful filenames:  

- `about_me.py`  
- `glglstats.py`  
- `ahuzat_dibuk.py`  
- `orienting.cpp`  
- `turing_jest.js`  
- `rhymes_extension.js`  
- `portfolio.html`  
- `contacts.json`  

When one of these files is “clicked” in the sidebar, the corresponding content appears in the main editor window as if it’s code, but actually styled text blocks laid out in code syntax highlighting. For example, function names in blue, strings in green, comments in gray italics. Syntax highlighting makes every section pop with its own flavor: Python-style formatting for the Python projects, C++ highlighting for the computational geometry work, JS/HTML highlighting for the web projects, and JSON-style formatting for the personal links section.  

At the very top of the editor, the site header is presented as a comment block:  

```  
# Geva Kipper  
# Software Engineer @ Google — currently building large-scale distributed systems  
# This site is dynamically re-designed every day by AI, making it ever-changing  
```  

Each section is designed like an interactive code snippet. For example:  

- **GlglStats project:** Styled like a Python file. When hovered, the YouTube link and project link “execute” a small interactive terminal output at the bottom of the editor, as if the snippet was being run (e.g., printing out a playful message: `--> Running LZ77 compression analysis... Output: Too much repetition detected!`).  

- **Ahuzat Dibuk:** With scraping and visualization, it’s presented as a Python script with arrays of “parking data” printed in colorful pseudo-heatmap ASCII art. Links to news articles expand inline when clicked, sliding open in a floating “docstring panel.”  

- **2D Part Orienting (C++):** The section looks like a C++ header and implementation. Hover animations draw vector diagrams in the background, subtle fading polygons aligning themselves as if being “pushed into orientation.”  

- **The Turing Jest:** Styled as a playful JavaScript file. When clicked, a mini interactive snippet lets the user type a word prompt, and an LLM mock-response with a pun appears inline in pseudo-console output format.  

- **Rhymes of Israel:** Styled like a Chrome extension background script, with animated fake headlines transforming into rhyming couplets in a neon-highlighted typewriter effect.  

- **Portfolio Website (meta):** Shown as an `index.html` file with a mock “<div id=‘portfolio’>...</div>” snippet, including a cheeky self-reference where clicking “render()” refreshes the current page to a slightly altered color scheme (reinforcing the “ever-changing AI design” subtitle).  

- **Contacts.json:** Links to GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook are displayed as a neat JSON object, keys in purple, values (links) in cyan. Clicking them opens the actual external profiles.  

At the very bottom of the page sits a **console-like footer panel** styled as a terminal prompt. On the left, it shows:  
`// Site generated by ChatGPT (AI model, 2025)`  

On the right, in glowing green monospace, a **live stopwatch** continuously counts the exact time elapsed since `2025-08-20 01:05:19`. It updates every second like a process timer, giving the sense that the portfolio is an ongoing “program execution.”  

The overall result is an **immersive faux-code environment**, creative yet professional—polished typography, smooth animations, and subtle custom syntax-color themes make the experience feel consistent with Geva’s software engineering identity, while the interactivity and playful snippets convey both technical skill and a sense of humor.
