# Portfolio Website Design: "Code That Builds"

## Core Concept
A single-page website that visually "builds itself" through animated code snippets as the user scrolls. Each section appears to be generated by code that writes itself in real-time, creating the impression that the visitor is watching the website being programmed before their eyes.

## Header
- The page starts with a terminal-like interface at the top
- A blinking cursor appears, then types out: `const developer = "Geva Kipper";`
- Below, it types: `// Currently engineering at Google, building tools that make the web better.`
- The subtitle then "types out": `// This website is redesigned daily by AI and is ever-changing.`
- The header has a subtle animation of code syntax highlighting activating as the text appears

## Scrolling Mechanism
- As the user scrolls down, a vertical timeline appears on the left side representing HTML/CSS/JS file structure
- Each scroll action triggers new "code" to appear and execute, building the next section
- Code snippets write themselves out, then "execute" to form the visible content

## Project Sections
Each project section follows this pattern:
1. Code appears to create a container div
2. Variables are "declared" with project information
3. The code then visually "renders" into the actual content

### GlglStats Section
- The code writes a Python-style analysis function first
- As the "code execution" completes, visualizations fade in showing sound wave patterns
- Project links appear as if from a "renderLinks()" function
- Background subtly incorporates music waveform patterns

### Ahuzat Dibuk Section
- Code starts by creating a data scraping function
- Animated heat map builds pixel by pixel as if being generated
- News links appear through a simulated API call
- Background uses a subtle parking lot grid pattern

### 2D Part Orienting Section
- C++ style code appears, creating geometric calculations
- Animated SVG showing a polygon being oriented by pushes
- Link appears as if from a compile command
- Background incorporates subtle geometric patterns

### Portfolio Website Section
- Meta section where the code appears to be writing itself
- Self-referential animation showing a miniature version of the site being built
- Link appears with a playful recursive animation
- Background uses a mirror-like pattern suggesting infinite recursion

### Contact Links Section
- Final code block appears to generate contact links
- Social icons build themselves through SVG path code
- Hover effects resemble code execution highlights
- Background has a subtle network connection pattern

## Visual Design Elements
- Color scheme: Dark mode with syntax highlighting colors (dark blue background, light text, with syntax colors like orange, green, blue)
- Font: Monospace for code sections, clean sans-serif for rendered content
- Cursor animations between sections resemble IDE/terminal interactions
- Line numbers appear alongside code blocks
- Occasional "comments" in the code provide personal touches

## Footer
- Shows credits to the AI model with: `// Designed by [AI Model Name]`
- Dynamic stopwatch counting time since April 8, 2025, 01:03:48
- The stopwatch code appears to be actively running with updating variables

## Progressive Enhancement
- Scrolling can be paused by clicking a "debug" button that appears in the corner
- Light/dark mode toggle styled as a code comment toggle
- Mobile version collapses the code visualization but maintains the build effect

## Easter Eggs
- Hovering on certain code sections reveals "comments" with personal anecdotes
- Console messages are available for visitors who inspect the page
- Clicking certain elements reveals "bug fixes" or additional animations
