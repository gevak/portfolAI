### **Portfolio Design: "The Git Timeline"**

**Overall Concept & Layout**

The website is a single, vertically scrolling page with a dark-mode, minimalist aesthetic. The screen is split into two main sections: a narrow left-hand column (approximately 25% of the viewport width) and a wider right-hand content area (75%). The core visual element is an animated, branching Git commit tree that lives exclusively in the left column, guiding the user through the portfolio.

**The Left Column: The Git Tree**

*   **Appearance:** Against a deep charcoal or navy-blue background, a vibrant, multi-colored Git graph is drawn vertically. The main "trunk" runs down the center of this column. Different projects "branch" off this trunk at various points. The lines are not straight but have a gentle, organic curve, rendered as SVG paths. Each branch has its own distinct color (e.g., neon green, cyan, magenta, orange).
*   **Commit Nodes:** Along the trunk and branches are circular "commit" nodes. These nodes are semi-transparent with a solid colored border matching their branch color. As you scroll, the node corresponding to the content currently visible in the right-hand panel will glow brightly and pulse gently.
*   **Commit Hashes & Titles:** Next to each commit node is a short, 7-character, randomized "commit hash" (e.g., `a1d3c7f`) in a small monospace font. Hovering over a node or its hash reveals a tooltip with the project's title.

**The Right Column: Content Panels ("Commit Details")**

This area displays the project details. As the user scrolls down, they are effectively scrolling back in time. Each project section appears sequentially, and the entire panel animates into view with a subtle fade-and-slide effect as its corresponding commit node in the left column becomes active.

**Header Section (Top of the Page)**

*   The page loads with the topmost section visible. In the right-hand panel, the name **Geva Kipper** appears in a large, clean, sans-serif font.
*   Directly below the name, in a smaller monospace font, is the description: `Working on core search features at Google.`
*   Underneath this is the subtitle: `// This site's design is regenerated daily by an AI. Its appearance is ever-changing.` The `//` gives it the look of a code comment.
*   In the left column, the top of the Git tree is visible, with a tag-like element pointing to the newest commit node, reading: `HEAD -> main`.

**Project Sections (The Commit Panels)**

Each project is presented in a "box" or panel that appears in the right-hand column as you scroll. The styling is consistent, resembling a developer's interface.

1.  **GlglStats:**
    *   **Header:** A monospace title like `feat(analysis): GlglStats`.
    *   **Content:** A short description of the project. A small, embedded, auto-playing (muted) video loop shows the animated repetition patterns from the project's visualizations.
    *   **Links:** Styled to look like command-line output.
        *   `> view_live_site: https://glglstats.geekip.dev`
        *   `> watch_talk: PyData TLV Presentation [YouTube]`
        The link text itself is clickable.

2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk:**
    *   **Header:** `feat(data-viz): Ahuzat Dibuk`.
    *   **Content:** Project description. A looping GIF of the generated heat-map is embedded.
    *   **Links:**
        *   `> coverage: Channel 13 News`
        *   `> coverage: Mako`
        *   `> source_post: Secret Tel Aviv [Facebook]`

3.  **2D Part Orienting:**
    *   **Header:** `feat(geometry): 2D Part Orienting`.
    *   **Content:** Project description. An animated SVG can show a simple polygon being pushed and rotated into its final orientation, visually explaining the algorithm's goal.
    *   **Links:**
        *   `> academic_info --code: TAU CGAL Project`

4.  **The Turing Jest:**
    *   **Header:** `feat(llm): The Turing Jest`.
    *   **Content:** Project description. A simple, animated text effect can show two example puns being generated and rated.
    *   **Links:**
        *   `> open_arena: https://jest.geekip.dev`

5.  **Rhymes of Israel:**
    *   **Header:** `fix(news): Rhymes of Israel`.
    *   **Content:** Project description. A before-and-after animation shows a standard news headline transforming into a rhyming, comedic one.
    *   **Links:**
        *   `> install_extension --chrome`

6.  **This Portfolio Website:**
    *   **Header:** `chore(meta): Portfolio Site v3.AI`. This is a self-referential "commit."
    *   **Content:** A single line: "The Git-inspired timeline you are currently viewing."
    *   **Links:**
        *   `> view_source_code_of_reality: https://geekip.dev`

7.  **Contact & Socials:**
    *   **Header:** `ref: find-me`. This commit node is styled differently, perhaps as a merge commit where multiple branches converge.
    *   **Content:** The right-hand panel simply contains three large, clickable icons with labels: `GitHub`, `LinkedIn`, `Facebook`.

**Footer**

At the very bottom of the page, visible after scrolling through all projects, is a fixed footer that stays at the bottom of the viewport once reached.

*   **Left Side:** A small, faded text: `UI/UX by Claude 3 Opus, an AI assistant.`
*   **Right Side:** A digital stopwatch in a monospace font, continuously counting up from the specified date and time:
    `UPTIME: 0000d 00h 00m 00s`
    This stopwatch shows the time elapsed since `2025-09-07 01:07:05`.
