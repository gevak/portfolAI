Create a single-page “brain-scan console” that feels like a hybrid of an fMRI viewer and a futuristic skills dashboard. The background is a dark, matte charcoal with a faint animated noise texture, overlaid by a large central “brain scan” silhouette rendered as soft, glowing contour lines (teal/cyan) with subtle pulsing. The page scroll is minimal and smooth; the primary interaction is hovering/tapping “neural regions” on the brain to reveal the portfolio sections as floating info-panels. Typography is clinical and modern: a clean sans (e.g., Inter/Manrope) for body, with a slightly condensed, techy display font for UI labels (e.g., Sora/Space Grotesk). Color palette: cyan/teal for active neural signals, violet for “AI re-design” accents, warm amber for warnings/labels, and off-white text for readability.

At the top, place a compact “Header HUD” pinned to the viewport: left side shows the name in a bold label—**Geva Kipper**—with a small status dot and a single sentence beneath: “Software engineer at Google, currently building and scaling production systems.” Right side shows a subtle subtitle in italic or lighter weight: “This portfolio is re-designed each day by AI—an ever-changing interface.” Between them, add a thin “EEG strip” line that gently animates and reacts to scroll/hover (purely aesthetic). The header remains minimal so the brain visualization remains the hero.

The center of the page is the “Neural Map.” The brain is divided into clickable/hoverable regions that correspond to the portfolio boxes; each region has a tiny label (like an anatomical annotation) and a faint ring highlight when near the cursor. On hover, a “synaptic connection” line animates from the region to a panel dock area (either right side on desktop or as a bottom sheet on mobile). Clicking locks the panel open. The panels are glassy (blurred translucent cards) with crisp borders and micro-grid texture, like a radiology overlay. Each panel is one of the sections below, styled as a “Region Report” with: title, one-sentence summary, key tags (language/stack), and action links (site/video/news/etc.) as pill buttons. The “ever-changing” AI daily redesign is expressed by small controlled variations: the brain contour color slightly shifts within the palette, the neural region arrangement subtly rebalances, and the ambient animation pattern changes—always elegant, never chaotic.

Design seven panels/boxes as “region cards” mapped to distinct neural areas, each with a unique iconography and signal pattern (e.g., repetitive waveforms for compression, heat-map gradients for parking occupancy, wireframe polygons for geometry). The sections should be:

1) **GlglStats** (mapped to an “Auditory Cortex” region): Card shows the title “GlglStats” and description: “Python project measuring repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression; visualizes repetition patterns across famous songs.” Include two prominent pills: **Visit** → https://glglstats.geekip.dev and **PyData TLV Talk (Video)** → https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo. Add a tiny repeating waveform motif behind the card title.

2) **Ahuzat Dibuk** (mapped to a “Spatial/Navigation” region): Card title “Ahuzat Dibuk” with description: “Python scraping + data visualization: Tel-Aviv parking lot occupancy statistics and resident-friendly heat-maps.” Add three link pills: **13tv Story** → https://13tv.co.il/item/news/domestic/internal/parking-902956407/, **mako Story** → https://www.mako.co.il/nexter-news/Article-ae43964b891bf71027.htm, **Original Facebook Post** → https://www.facebook.com/groups/secrettelaviv/posts/10159636301195943/. The card’s background accent uses a soft animated heat-map gradient that slowly shifts.

3) **2D Part Orienting** (mapped to a “Motor Planning” region): Card title “2D Part Orienting” with description: “C++ implementation in an open-source computational geometry library: efficient construction of a ‘push plan’ to orient a given polygon.” Include one primary link: **Details & Code** → https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/. Visual accent: a rotating wireframe polygon outline and a faint vector arrow path.

4) **The Turing Jest** (mapped to a “Language & Humor” region): Card title “The Turing Jest” with description: “An LMSYS-like arena where LLMs compete at making and explaining puns; users rate the results.” Link pill: **Open Arena** → https://jest.geekip.dev. Accent: a subtle “speech bubble” outline and a tiny rating bar animation (non-interactive).

5) **Rhymes of Israel** (mapped to a “Creative Rewrite” region): Card title “Rhymes of Israel” with description: “Chrome extension using an LLM to rewrite Israeli news headlines into comedic rhymes, like a high-school yearbook.” Link pill: **Install Extension** → https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eainginjgdkpgolpjniijdihfbeeeklb. Accent: slanted rhyming couplet lines that fade in/out lightly behind the header.

6) **geekip.dev (Portfolio Site)** (mapped to a “Self-Model/Meta” region near the center): Card title “Portfolio (Meta)” with description: “A portfolio website project—this very brain-scan interface.” Link pill: **Self Reference** → https://geekip.dev. Accent: a small recursive frame effect (a tiny card within a card) done tastefully.

7) **Links / Social Hub** (mapped to a “Connectome” region): Card title “Connect” with three large, clean icon buttons and text links: **GitHub** → github.com/gevak, **LinkedIn** → linkedin.com/in/gevakip, **Facebook** → facebook.com/geva.kipper. Visual accent: three nodes connected by animated dotted lines that “pulse” when hovered.

At the bottom, include a slim “Footer Diagnostics Bar” that looks like a scan readout. Left side: “Generated by: ChatGPT (AI model)” as the credit, in small uppercase with a subtle divider line. Right side: a live “Uptime Since Scan Start” stopwatch showing **hours:minutes:seconds since 2025-12-25 01:10:39**, styled like a medical device timer (monospaced digits, softly glowing). The stopwatch increments smoothly every second. The footer remains visible or appears on slight scroll down, but should not distract from the brain map.

Interaction details: hovering a brain region previews its card (ghosted, slightly blurred), clicking pins it with crisp focus and expands it to show links; the other regions dim slightly to emphasize the active selection. On mobile, the brain sits at top, and tapping opens a bottom sheet card with the same content and links. Keep animations slow and refined: pulsing outlines, gentle line draws, and micro-parallax of the brain contours on cursor movement. The overall feeling should be elegant, inventive, and unmistakably “brain-scan UI mapping skills to neural regions,” while staying readable and professional.
