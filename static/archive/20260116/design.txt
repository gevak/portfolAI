**Visual Style and Atmosphere**
The website should adopt a **"Cyber-Fintech" aesthetic**, blending the tactile nostalgia of a physical ATM machine with clean, modern Neomorphism. The background should be a deep, matte charcoal grey with a subtle brushed metal texture. The UI elements should utilize "Glassmorphism"—semi-transparent, frosted glass panels with soft glowing borders in electric blue and mint green (representing data and currency). The typography should be a mix of high-end sans-serif for headers and a sharp, pixelated monospace font (like OCRA or VT323) for data readouts, mimicking a banking terminal.

**Header Section: The "Account" Header**
At the top of the "screen," display a digital status bar. On the left, Geva Kipper’s name should appear as the "Account Holder," with his role "Software Engineer @ Google" displayed as the "Account Status." Below this, include a scrolling ticker-tape (marquee style) featuring the subtitle in a glitchy, terminal font: *"System Message: This interface is re-designed daily by AI. Architecture is ever-changing."* This sets the dynamic tone immediately.

**Main Interface: The Transaction Grid (Projects)**
The core of the page is a 2x3 grid of large, interactive touch-screen buttons, representing the six projects. These should look like ATM "Quick Cash" options. When hovered, the buttons should elevate and glow.

1.  **Selection 1: GlglStats (The Audit)**
    *   *Label:* "Audio Pattern Analysis"
    *   *Visuals:* A mini audio-waveform animation.
    *   *Content:* When clicked, this card expands to show the LZ77 repetition metrics. Embed the PyData YouTube video inside a mock "Security Camera" frame. The link to `glglstats.geekip.dev` should be styled as a "Print Report" button.

2.  **Selection 2: Ahuzat Dibuk (Asset Occupancy)**
    *   *Label:* "Parking Log Scraping"
    *   *Visuals:* A heatmap icon that shifts colors from green to red.
    *   *Content:* Display the project description as a scrolling "Transaction Log." The links to 13tv, Mako, and Facebook should be styled as "External Receipt" buttons.

3.  **Selection 3: 2D Part Orienting (Logistics)**
    *   *Label:* "Geometry Alignment Output"
    *   *Visuals:* An animated polygon rotating into a fixed position.
    *   *Content:* Describe the C++ algorithm as a "System Optimization Protocol." The link to the project details should fit the theme of accessing source code.

4.  **Selection 4: The Turing Jest (Currency Exchange)**
    *   *Label:* "Humor Exchange Rate"
    *   *Visuals:* Two chat bubbles weighing against each other on a scale.
    *   *Content:* Frame the LMSYS arena concept as a competition between AI "tellers." The link to `jest.geekip.dev` should read "Enter Trading Floor."

5.  **Selection 5: Rhymes of Israel (Encryption)**
    *   *Label:* "Headline Re-Encryption"
    *   *Visuals:* A newspaper icon transforming into a musical note.
    *   *Content:* Present the Chrome extension link as a "Install Software Patch" button.

6.  **Selection 6: Meta-Portfolio (Diagnostics)**
    *   *Label:* "System Self-Diagnostics"
    *   *Visuals:* An isometric recursion icon (a screen within a screen).
    *   *Content:* A playful "Infinite Loop Detected" warning. The link to `geekip.dev` should be circular, initiating a page refresh simulation.

**The "Control Panel" Sidebar (Resume, Skills, & Socials)**
To the right (Desktops) or bottom (Mobile) of the project grid, simulate the physical interface of an ATM:

*   **"Withdraw" Resume:** A large, physical-looking slot. When the user clicks "Withdraw Resume," use a CSS animation to slide a paper receipt down from the top of the screen. The receipt is the PDF resume.
*   **"Check Balance" (Skills):** A button labeled "View Balance." Clicking this triggers a modal overlay showing a bank statement where "Currency" is replaced by programming languages (e.g., *Python: $10,000 credit*, *C++: High Yield Asset*).
*   **The Keypad (Social Links):** A numeric keypad where the function keys serve as social links.
    *   *Enter (Green):* GitHub (github.com/gevak) representing "Commit/Push."
    *   *Clear (Yellow):* LinkedIn (linkedin.com/in/gevakip) representing "Professional Networking."
    *   *Cancel (Red):* Facebook (facebook.com/geva.kipper) representing "Social Exit."

**Footer: The System Clock**
The bottom strip of the layout should look like the machine's hardware ID plate.
*   **Text:** *"Interface generated by AI Model [Insert Model Name]."*
*   **The Chronometer:** A prominent digital clock count with red LED styling. It should display the time elapsed since **2026-01-16 01:14:05**.
    *   *Note to Designer:* If the current date is before the target date, format the timer as "T-Minus [Time]" (Countdown to Launch). If after, format as "System Uptime: [Time]" (Time since "The Event"). This adds a sci-fi mystery element to the specific date requirement.
