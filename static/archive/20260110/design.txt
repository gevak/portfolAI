**Visual Style & Atmosphere**
The website should adopt a sophisticated "Neo-Retro/Cyberpunk" aesthetic. The dominant background color must be deep void black (`#050505`). The primary accent color is a sharp, fluorescent "terminal green" (`#00FF41`), with secondary accents in muted code-syntax colors (cyan and magenta) to differentiate links. Typography should rely heavily on modern monospace fonts (e.g., *Fira Code* or *JetBrains Mono*) to maintain the software engineering theme. The interface should feel alive, with subtle cursor glow effects and low-hum CRT monitor flickers.

**Header Section**
The top of the page features a minimalist header.
*   **Name & Role:** "Geva Kipper" should be displayed in large, bold <h1> pixel-text. Below it, a single line blinking like a command-line prompt: *"Currently engineering the future at Google."*
*   **The AI Disclaimer:** Positioned slightly offset or as a running marquee ribbon: *"Notice: This interface is re-designed daily by AI. Entropy level: Variable."*
*   **Interaction:** On load, the text should type itself out character by character.

**The "Freezing Rain" Grid Layout**
The core content acts as a "Bento Box" grid of six rectangular cards (two per row or responsive equivalent).
*   **Idle State:** By default, each project card does *not* show an image. Instead, each card acts as a window into the "Matrix." Inside the borders of the card, streams of binary code (0s and 1s) and hex characters rain down vertically.
*   **Hover State (The "Freeze"):** When the user hovers over a specific box, the physics of that box change instantly. The raining characters stop falling and "solidify," snapping into position to form the pixels of a screenshot or project logo. The text overlay (Title, Description, Links) fades in sharply over the frozen data-image in high-contrast black boxes.
*   **Click State:** A subtle "glitch" effect occurs on click before navigating to the link.

**Project Card Details**

1.  **GlglStats:**
    *   **Visual:** The binary rain freezes into a data-visualization waveform or a pie chart.
    *   **Content:** Title "GlglStats" in bold. Description text focusing on LZ77 compression and pop-music repetition.
    *   **Action:** Two distinct buttons: "Launch App" (pointing to git.geekip.dev) and "Watch PyData Design" (pointing to the YouTube link).

2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk:**
    *   **Visual:** The binary rain freezes into a red-and-green topography heat map representing parking lots.
    *   **Content:** Description highlighting the Python scraping and Tel-Aviv parking utility.
    *   **Action:** A cluster of "News Coverage" links (Channel 13, Mako) and the "Original Source" link (Facebook).

3.  **2D Part Orienting:**
    *   **Visual:** The characters freeze into geometric polygon wireframes.
    *   **Content:** Technical description regarding C++ and computational geometry.
    *   **Action:** A "View Source & Docs" button linking to the TAU project page.

4.  **The Turing Jest:**
    *   **Visual:** The rain freezes into a split-screen chat interface (resembling an LLM arena).
    *   **Content:** Explanation of the LLM pun competition and rating system.
    *   **Action:** A "Enter Arena" button linking to jest.geekip.dev.

5.  **Rhymes of Israel:**
    *   **Visual:** The matrix code morphs into the texture of a digital newspaper or high-school yearbook page.
    *   **Content:** Description of the Chrome extension and its comedic, rhyming headline functionality.
    *   **Action:** "Install Extension" button with a Chrome Web Store icon.

6.  **Portfolio (Meta):**
    *   **Visual:** An "Infinity Mirror" effect where the rain simulates the website looking at itself.
    *   **Content:** "A recursive reference to the site you are currently viewing."
    *   **Action:** A link that simply reloads the page or anchors to the top (geekip.dev).

**Social & Contact Section (Section 7)**
Below the main grid, a horizontal bar section spans the width.
*   Instead of rain, this section features static ASCII art icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook.
*   On hover, the icons glow intensely, and the borders of the section pulse.

**Footer & Temporal Paradox**
The bottom-most element is a footer with a distinct border.
*   **Credits:** "Site Architecture: AI Model [Model Name]. Human Input: Geva Kipper."
*   **The Stopwatch:** A digital segment display (red or amber to contrast the green). It displays a counter labeled: *"Time elapsed since Singularity Event (2026-01-10 01:10:51):"*
*   **Functionality:** If the current date is before 2026, the timer should show negative time (counting up toward zero) or a "temporal error" flickering effect. If after, it counts usually. The format should be `HH:MM:SS` including total accumulated hours.
