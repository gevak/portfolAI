### Portfolio Design: The Unlocked Skill Tree

**Overall Concept:**

The website is a single, continuous vertical scroll that reveals an interactive, animated skill tree. The background is a dark, deep space blue with a subtle, slow-moving particle effect, reminiscent of a digital cosmos or a neural network. As the user scrolls down, glowing, energetic lines animate to connect different "skill nodes," which are the projects. The aesthetic is clean, futuristic, and elegant, blending a sci-fi user interface with the structure of a classic RPG skill tree. The primary color for interactive elements and highlights is a vibrant cyan, with secondary accents in a soft magenta for specific call-to-action buttons.

**The Initial View (The Root Node):**

Upon landing on the page, the user sees the center of the screen dominated by a large, pulsating hexagonal node. Inside this node, the name **Geva Kipper** is displayed in a clean, bold, sans-serif font. Directly beneath the name, within the same hexagon, is the single sentence: "Software Engineer at Google, building intelligent systems for creativity and communication."

Below this central node, a subtitle appears with a subtle "glitch" animation, as if the text is refreshing. It reads: "This portfolio is procedurally generated by AI every 24 hours. The layout you see is unique to today."

A small, animated chevron points downwards, pulsing gently, inviting the user to scroll down and begin unlocking the skill tree.

**The Skill Tree & Project Nodes:**

As the user scrolls, the view pans downwards, and a glowing cyan line animates out from the central "Geva Kipper" node, branching off to the first project. Each project is contained within its own hexagonal node, smaller than the root node. When a node scrolls into the viewport, it "activates": its border glows brighter, a faint hum sound effect can be heard, and the content inside fades into view.

Each project node is structured with:
*   **Project Title:** Large and bold at the top.
*   **Skill Tags:** Small, glowing lozenges directly under the title, indicating the core technologies (e.g., `Python`, `C++`, `LLM`, `Data Viz`, `Web Scraping`).
*   **Description:** A concise paragraph explaining the project.
*   **Action Buttons:** Stylized buttons with icons at the bottom of the node. On hover, they glow intensely and the icon animates.

**1. Project Node: GlglStats**
This node branches off to the left. The connecting line is labeled with a glowing `Python` and `Data Analysis` tag.
*   **Description:** "A Python project measuring the repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression, complete with visualizations of repetition patterns in famous tracks."
*   **Buttons:**
    *   `VISIT SITE` (Icon: Globe) -> `https://glglstats.geekip.dev`
    *   `WATCH TALK` (Icon: Play Button) -> `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo`

**2. Project Node: Ahuzat Dibuk**
This node branches off to the right, also from the main `Python` branch.
*   **Description:** "A data project that scrapes and visualizes occupancy statistics for Tel-Aviv parking lots, generating real-time heatmaps to help residents find parking."
*   **Buttons:**
    *   `NEWS: CHANNEL 13` (Icon: Newspaper) -> `https://13tv.co.il/item/news/domestic/internal/parking-902956407/`
    *   `NEWS: MAKO` (Icon: Newspaper) -> `https://www.mako.co.il/nexter-news/Article-ae43964b891bf71027.htm`
    *   `READ ON FACEBOOK` (Icon: Thumbs Up) -> `https://www.facebook.com/groups/secrettelaviv/posts/10159636301195943/`

**3. Project Node: 2D Part Orienting**
A new, distinct branch animates downwards, labeled `C++` and `Computational Geometry`.
*   **Description:** "A C++ implementation of an efficient algorithm that constructs a 'push plan' to orient any given polygon, contributed to an open-source computational geometry library."
*   **Buttons:**
    *   `VIEW CODE & INFO` (Icon: Code Brackets) -> `https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/`

**4. Project Node: The Turing Jest**
A major new branch appears, labeled `LLM` and `Full-Stack`. This branch will also be the parent for the next project.
*   **Description:** "An LMSYS-style arena where Large Language Models compete at generating and explaining puns. Users rate the responses to determine the wittiest AI."
*   **Buttons:**
    *   `LAUNCH ARENA` (Icon: Rocket) -> `https://jest.geekip.dev`

**5. Project Node: Rhymes of Israel**
This node branches directly off "The Turing Jest" node, showing a progression of skills.
*   **Description:** "A Chrome extension that leverages an LLM to humorously rewrite Israeli news headlines into rhyming couplets, styled like a high-school yearbook."
*   **Buttons:**
    *   `INSTALL EXTENSION` (Icon: Jigsaw Puzzle Piece) -> `https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eainginjgdkpgolpjniijdihfbeeeklb`

**6. Project Node: The Portfolio (Meta)**
A final, smaller branch loops back towards the central vertical axis of the page.
*   **Description:** "This website. An ever-changing, AI-designed portfolio built as a single-page application to represent my work through an unlockable skill tree."
*   **Buttons:**
    *   `VIEW SOURCE` (Icon: Code Brackets) -> `https://geekip.dev` (self-referencing link)

**The Final Node (Connections Hub):**

After the last project, all the glowing lines converge into a final, large, circular node at the bottom of the page. This node acts as the "contact" or "social" hub. It features large, high-contrast icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook, arranged horizontally. Clicking an icon opens the corresponding profile in a new tab.

*   `github.com/gevak`
*   `linkedin.com/in/gevakip`
*   `facebook.com/geva.kipper`

**Footer:**

At the very bottom of the page, below the social hub, is a minimalist footer.
*   On the left, in a small, elegant font: "AI Design & Concept by Claude 3 Opus."
*   On the right, a dynamic stopwatch with a label above it reading "Time since last AI-driven redesign:". The stopwatch actively counts up in `HH:MM:SS` from the specified timestamp of `2025-07-13 01:18:44`, using a monospaced, digital-style font.
