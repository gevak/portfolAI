# Vinyl Record Player Portfolio Design

The entire page background features a rich, dark walnut wood grain texture, evoking a vintage hi-fi cabinet. At the top center, display "GEVA KIPPER" in bold, gold metallic lettering styled like 1970s album cover typography. Directly beneath, in smaller elegant serif text, place his one-sentence Google description. Below that, in italic script resembling handwritten liner notes, add the subtitle about the AI-redesigned daily nature of the site.

The centerpiece is a large, realistic vinyl record turntable positioned in the upper-middle portion of the screen. The turntable features a black spinning vinyl record (with actual CSS rotation animation), a tonearm with a needle touching the record's surface, and chrome details catching light. The vinyl's label in the center displays "Side A: Projects" in vintage record label typography.

The six project boxes are arranged as album covers scattered around the turntable in a gentle arc formation, three on each side, slightly overlapping like records being browsed in a crate. Each "album cover" is a square card with:
- A unique, generative geometric pattern in the background (different color schemes: GlglStats in vibrant blues/purples, Ahuzat Dibuk in parking-lot grays and yellows, 2D Part Orienting in mathematical greens, Turing Jest in comedy club reds, Rhymes of Israel in newspaper blacks/whites, and the meta portfolio site in gold/bronze)
- The project title at the top in record label font
- Project description in clean sans-serif, appearing as "track listings"
- Links styled as small vinyl record icons that spin on hover
- Each card tilts slightly (3-5 degrees) in alternating directions for a casual, browsed-through aesthetic

When hovering over any album cover, it lifts up slightly with a shadow effect, the vinyl record on the turntable changes its label to match that project's color scheme, and a glowing equalizer visualization appears at the bottom of the turntable, with bars bouncing in rhythm (different patterns for each project). The tonearm subtly moves as if switching tracks.

The seventh box (social links) appears as a 45 RPM adapter insert placed on the turntable's spindle area, circular in shape, with the GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook icons arranged around it like holes in a record adapter. These icons are styled as vintage button badges.

At the very bottom, on a strip resembling a vinyl record's run-out groove etching, display the AI credit in tiny, all-caps text on the left side. On the right side, the stopwatch appears as a classic analog turntable's speed indicator dial (showing 33⅓ RPM symbolically), but with digital numbers inside showing the elapsed time since the specified timestamp, updating in real-time with a subtle flicker like old LED displays.

Subtle audio-reactive elements: faint waveform patterns pulse very gently in the background wood grain, and tiny dust particles float across the screen as if illuminated by soft studio lighting hitting the turntable.
