The website design concept is a custom-built retro handheld console, the **"GEEKIP-DEV 01"**. The entire browser window is filled with the console's form, rendered with a realistic plastic texture in a classic, muted Game Boy-gray. The layout is fixed and does not scroll; all interaction happens within the console's screen and controls. The console is presented front-on, with subtle CSS gradients and box-shadows to give it a 3D, physical appearance.

At the top of the console is its "screen," a rectangular area with a slightly darker bezel. The screen itself has a pale green-yellow monochrome LCD background, overlaid with a faint, semi-transparent dot-matrix grid and subtle scanline effect to perfectly emulate a vintage handheld display. Upon loading, a brief boot-up animation plays on the screen: a pixelated logo "GEEKIP-DEV" appears with a classic 8-bit chime.

The main screen content appears after the boot-up. At the top, in a large, blocky pixel font, is the name **"Geva Kipper"**. Below it, in a smaller pixel font, is his role: "Currently building the future of computing at Google." Beneath this, a subtitle is displayed, with a perpetual "glitch" animation where characters occasionally flicker or change: *"This site's design is regenerated daily by AI & is ever-changing."* The main body of the screen is a vertical list of selectable "game" titles, representing the projects. Navigation is handled by clicking on-screen controls or using keyboard arrow keys. A small, pixelated arrow `>` indicates the currently selected item.

To the left of the screen is a functional, clickable D-pad for navigating the project list. To the right are two primary buttons: a red 'A' button (for "Select") and a blue 'B' button (for "Back"). Below the screen are two smaller, oblong "Start" and "Select" buttons. The entire interface is interactive with 8-bit sound effects: a 'blip' for navigation, a 'confirm' sound for selection, and a 'cancel' swoosh for going back.

When a project title is selected from the main list, the screen transitions with a quick wipe effect. The new screen displays the project details in a two-column layout. On the left, a unique piece of pixel art represents the project (e.g., a musical note and a graph for 'GlglStats'; a parking lot icon for 'Ahuzat Dibuk'; a triangulated polygon for '2D Part Orienting'). On the right, the project's title is displayed, followed by a short description. Below the description is a list of links (e.g., "VIEW SITE", "WATCH TALK", "READ NEWS"), which act as menu items. Hovering over a link highlights it. Clicking a link opens it in a new tab. Pressing the 'B' button returns the user to the main project selection menu.

Below the main controls sits the "cartridge bay," a horizontal row of six game cartridges. Each cartridge is a small, visual representation of a project, featuring its pixel art icon and title. The cartridge corresponding to the currently highlighted project on the screen glows softly. Users can also click directly on these cartridges to load the project details onto the screen, providing an alternative navigation method. The six "game" cartridges are GlglStats, Ahuzat Dibuk, 2D Part Orienting, The Turing Jest, and Rhymes of Israel. The sixth cartridge is labeled "THIS WEBSITE" which, when selected, displays the project information for the portfolio itself, with a link back to the homepage. The seventh section, containing social media links, is accessed via a dedicated menu item on the main screen labeled "CONNECT", which leads to a simple screen displaying pixel art icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook, each linking out.

At the very bottom of the console's plastic casing, as if it were part of the hardware itself, is a small, dedicated LCD-style strip. This strip contains a running stopwatch labeled "SYSTEM UPTIME," continuously counting up in HH:MM:SS from the specified date and time of 2025-09-24 01:03:31. To the right of this, 'engraved' in a small, capitalized font into the console's plastic casing, is the credit: "DESIGN CORE: ANTHROPIC CLAUDE 3."
