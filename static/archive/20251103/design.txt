# Terminal Interface Portfolio Design

The page opens with a full-screen dark terminal interface using a monospace font (JetBrains Mono or Fira Code), with a color scheme inspired by the classic Monokai theme—deep charcoal background (#272822) with vibrant accent colors: electric green (#A6E22E) for text, bright cyan (#66D9EF) for commands, soft orange (#FD971F) for highlights, and magenta (#F92672) for links.

At the top, display a terminal prompt showing `visitor@geekip.dev:~$` with a blinking cursor. Above the prompt, show an ASCII art banner spelling "GEVA KIPPER" in a pixelated terminal font style, followed by a single line in green text: "Building developer tools and infrastructure at Google." Immediately below, in dimmed gray italics, the subtitle reads: "// This portfolio regenerates daily through AI—a new design with each dawn."

The main terminal window displays a boot-up sequence animation on page load, with lines rapidly scrolling: system checks, loading modules, and finally settling on a help menu that lists available commands: `ls projects`, `cat about`, `cd [project-name]`, `open links`, and `help`. This creates the illusion of an actual terminal environment.

The six project boxes appear as terminal "windows" or "panes" in a 2x3 grid layout, each styled as a nested terminal session with slightly lighter backgrounds (#3E3D32) and colored left borders corresponding to project categories. Each box header shows the command that "opened" it (e.g., `$ cat glglstats.txt`), followed by the project content displayed as terminal output.

**Project Box 1 (GlglStats)**: Shows green-bordered terminal pane with the title rendered in ASCII art smaller style. Content displays as if reading a README file, with bullet points using `>` characters. The YouTube link appears as `[VIDEO]` in cyan, and the site link as `[DEMO]` in magenta, both underlined with terminal-style effects.

**Project Box 2 (Ahuzat Dibuk)**: Orange-bordered pane displaying parking lot data as if it's a command output with small ASCII car symbols. News links appear as numbered references `[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]` with URLs listed at the bottom of the box in a bibliography style.

**Project Box 3 (2D Part Orienting)**: Blue-bordered pane showing geometric symbols created with ASCII characters (triangles, polygons using `/\\/` patterns). The academic link styled as `[PAPER+CODE]` in a scholarly citation format.

**Project Box 4 (The Turing Jest)**: Magenta-bordered pane with small ASCII comedy masks or quotation marks framing the description. The link styled as `[LAUNCH ARENA]` with a playful cursor animation suggesting clicking.

**Project Box 5 (Rhymes of Israel)**: Yellow-bordered pane with Hebrew-like ASCII decorations (using similar-looking English characters). The Chrome store link appears as `[INSTALL .crx]` mimicking a file download.

**Project Box 6 (Portfolio)**: Cyan-bordered pane with a recursive terminal window ASCII art showing a tiny version of the current page within itself. Link appears as `[RECURSIVE_LINK]` with a self-referential arrow symbol `↻`.

**Project Box 7 (Social Links)**: White-bordered pane at the bottom spanning full width, displaying three columns with ASCII logos for each platform (GitHub's octocat, LinkedIn's "in" symbol, Facebook's "f" in ASCII art) and URLs as clickable cyan text.

Throughout the page, implement typing animations when users first land—commands appear to type themselves out. Hovering over any clickable element changes the cursor to a block terminal cursor and adds a subtle glow effect. Clicking links briefly shows a terminal-style loading message before navigation.

At the absolute bottom, in the smallest terminal font size and dimmed gray (#75715E), display: `Generated by Claude (Anthropic) | Uptime: [XX]h [XX]m [XX]s since 2025-11-03 01:09:14` with the stopwatch updating in real-time using JavaScript.

Add an interactive command input field fixed at the bottom of the viewport that actually works—users can type commands like `help`, `ls`, `clear`, or project names to navigate. Invalid commands return `command not found: [input]` in red text. The entire interaction feels like using a real terminal, with command history accessible via up/down arrows and tab-completion for available commands.
