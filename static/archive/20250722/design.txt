### Portfolio Design: The "Debug" Sequence

**Theme:** An interactive "debugging" experience that reveals the portfolio. The aesthetic is a blend of a glitched-out terminal and a clean, minimalist code editor. The user journey is a single, satisfying animation from chaos to clarity.

**Initial State on Load:**

The page loads in a "broken" or "uncompiled" state. The background is a dark charcoal grey (#1a1a1a) with a faint, pulsing grid overlay. All text is rendered in a monospace font like Fira Code or Source Code Pro.

-   **Header:** The name "Geva Kipper" is visible but heavily artifacted. Letters flicker, some are replaced with random characters (#, %, *), and the kerning is erratic. Below it, the one-liner about Google is a garbled block of un-styled text, partially overlapping the name.
-   **Subtitle:** The line "This website is re-designed each day by AI and is thus ever-changing" is present but displayed as if it's a commented-out line of code (`// This website is...`), with a low-opacity grey color.
-   **Central Element:** At the center of the viewport, a single, glowing, green terminal-style cursor blinks expectantly: `> _`
-   **Project Boxes:** The seven boxes are arranged haphazardly on the screen, some overlapping, some rotated slightly. They are not identifiable as projects yet. Instead, they are filled with scrolling, syntax-highlighted gibberish code, random CSS properties (`z-index: -999; transform: rotate(3deg);`), or ASCII art representations of gears and circuits. They have no visible titles or links.

**The "Debug" Interaction & Animation:**

The entire page is inert until the user performs a single action: clicking anywhere on the page or pressing any key. This triggers the "debug sequence":

1.  **Command Execution:** The blinking cursor `> _` types out a command like `> system.render(true)` and a flashing "EXECUTING..." message appears.
2.  **Console Scroll:** A simulated console log rapidly scrolls down from the top of the screen, overlaying everything for a moment. It shows messages like:
    `[INFO] Initializing DOM...`
    `[INFO] Parsing assets...`
    `[WARN] Layout conflicts detected: 7 elements.`
    `[INFO] Applying AI visual patch v.2025.07.22...`
    `[INFO] Recompiling CSS matrix...`
    `[SUCCESS] Render complete.`
3.  **The "Fix":** As the console log scrolls and fades out, the elements on the page animate into their final, correct positions with a smooth, fluid transition (lasting about 1.5 seconds). The jumbled name and text snap into a clean, modern font. The skewed project boxes de-rotate, align perfectly into a grid, and the gibberish code within them is replaced by their actual content. The transition effect is like a digital wave washing over the page, leaving a clean, organized layout in its wake.

**Final "Rendered" State:**

The aesthetic is now ultra-clean, minimalist, and professional, retaining the dark theme. The font shifts from monospace to a clean sans-serif like Inter or Helvetica Neue for readability.

-   **Header:** "Geva Kipper" is now in a bold, white font. Below it, the sentence about his work at Google appears in a smaller, light-grey font. The subtitle about the AI redesign is now clearly legible, perhaps with a small, subtly animated icon (like a cog turning into a brain) next to it.
-   **Project Grid:** The seven boxes are now perfectly aligned in a responsive grid. Each box has a consistent design: a dark grey background slightly lighter than the page background, with a thin, glowing border (e.g., electric blue) that intensifies on hover.
-   **Box Content Design:**
    -   **Default State (No Hover):** Each box displays only the project title in a bold font (e.g., 'GlglStats') and a single, minimalist icon representing the project's core concept (e.g., a soundwave for GlglStats, a map pin for Ahuzat Dibuk, a polygon for 2D Part Orienting, a jester hat for The Turing Jest, a newspaper for Rhymes of Israel, a recursive square for the portfolio itself, and chain links for the 'Connect' box).
    -   **Hover State:** As the user hovers over a box, a smooth animation occurs. The icon fades out, and the detailed content fades in. The project description appears, followed by clearly labeled, clickable links. Each link is accompanied by a small icon (a play button for the video, a globe for the website, etc.). This keeps the initial view uncluttered while making the content discoverable.
-   **Links:** All external links (news, projects, GitHub) are styled to be obvious, perhaps changing color and gaining an underline on hover. The self-referencing link for the portfolio project could trigger a small, playful animation, like a quick screen shake or a "You are here" pop-up.
-   **Footer:** At the very bottom of the page, centered and in a small, discreet font, is the final element. The text reads:
    `Design generated by an AI assistant. Time since this design was rendered: [HH:MM:SS]`
    The `[HH:MM:SS]` is a live stopwatch, rendered in a monospace font as a nod to the site's theme, actively counting up from the specified date and time.
