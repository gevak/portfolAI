**Overall Concept & Aesthetic: "The Sentient Notebook"**
The website utilizes a "Computational Notebook" format (similar to an ultra-modern, stylized Jupyter Notebook or VS Code interface). The background is a deep, slow-moving twilight-blue mesh gradient that gives a feeling of a living, breathing system. The main container is centered, styled like an elegant, frosted-glass editor window (glassmorphism) with soft drop shadows, a sleek tab bar at the top (`geva_kipper.ts`), and macOS-style window controls. As the user scrolls, a blinking cursor rapidly types out the narrative of Geva's professional life in monospaced, brightly syntax-highlighted "code blocks." Immediately after a code block finishes typing, an "Output Cell" expands beneath it—revealing a beautiful, high-fidelity graphic UI card containing the actual project details and links.

**Header Section: The Preamble**
The top of the page acts as the initialization script. An automated cursor types out the root variables:
`const developer = "Geva Kipper";`
`const role = "[Insert the single sentence explaining current work at Google here]";`
Beneath this, a pulsing AI-generated comment block appears in bright, neon-orange italics:
`// SYSTEM NOTICE: This interface is procedurally mutated and re-designed daily by AI. Expect architectural shifts.`
This header stays sticky at the very top, minimizing slightly as the user scrolls down the page.

**The Output Cells (The 7 Sections)**
The core page content consists of seven distinct blocks. Each block is preceded by a fast-typing code snippet (e.g., `await loadProject('GlglStats');`), which seamlessly triggers the render of an elegant, interactive frosted-glass card below it. 

*   **Box 1: GlglStats**
    The UI card features a subtle background animation of data blocks condensing (representing LZ77 compression) merging into soundwaves. The text describes the Israeli pop-chart repetitiveness study. At the bottom, two sleek, pill-shaped buttons with glowing hover effects house the links: one pointing to the live site at `glglstats.geekip.dev`, and a play-icon button linking to the PyData TLV YouTube video.
*   **Box 2: Ahuzat Dibuk**
    The background of this card displays a faint, dark-mode topographical map of Tel-Aviv overlaid with a glowing, animated heatmap texture reflecting parking block occupancy. The project's description floats above the map. Below the text, three interconnected glowing nodes connected by a thin line serve as the media links: standard icons to channel 13tv.co.il and Mako, alongside a distinct Facebook icon linking to the Secret Tel-Aviv original post.
*   **Box 3: 2D Part Orienting**
    This card utilizes a rigid, geometric aesthetic. A minimalist background animation shows a neon polygon being repeatedly pushed and aligned against a conceptual flat plane. The typography here is sharp and technical, explaining the C++ computational geometry algorithm. A clean, ghost-style button reads "Inspect Logic & Docs," linking directly to the CGL Tel Aviv University project page.
*   **Box 4: The Turing Jest**
    Designed as a digital arena, this card uses a split-diagonal color background (crimson red vs. electric blue) to signify the competitive nature of the LMSYS-like LLM arena. A subtle theatre-mask watermark rests behind the text detailing the pun battleground. A prominent, playful CTA button points to `jest.geekip.dev`.
*   **Box 5: Rhymes of Israel**
    This card juxtaposes two distinct visual styles: a monochromatic grid resembling a digital newspaper layout that smoothly fades into a colorful, holographic, high-school yearbook aesthetic on the right edge. The text explains the comedic LLM news rewriting. A recognizable "Add to Chrome" Web Store badge anchors the bottom of the card for direct installation.
*   **Box 6: The Meta Portfolio**
    This card breaks the fourth wall using a CSS "infinite mirror" or recursive drop-shadow effect, showing a miniature, blurred version of the exact website the user and AI are currently building. The typography playfully references its own existence. The entire card operates as an interactive surface linking back to `geekip.dev`.
*   **Box 7: Network & Social Connections**
    Styled as a final `export module` block, this section abandons the card format for a clean, horizontally aligned dock of floating icons. Rendered in a monochrome, high-contrast style that illuminates with brand colors (GitHub Black/White, LinkedIn Blue, Facebook Blue) upon hover, these links provide instant access to github.com/gevak, linkedin.com/in/gevakip, and facebook.com/geva.kipper. 

**The Bottom Terminal: Footer & Timer**
Framing the bottom edge of the screen is a static "Terminal Console" drawer. It features a completely black background with classic lime-green terminal text. The first line reads: `> Build gracefully compiled by [Insert Your AI Model Name Here]`. 
The second line acts as a live server-status monitor. Alongside a flashing green status dot, a digital stopwatch constantly ticks upward, visibly counting the hours, minutes, and seconds elapsed since `2026-02-25 01:29:56`, reinforcing the temporal, ever-changing theme of the site.
