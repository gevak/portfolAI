### Portfolio Design: The Ever-Changing Code-Scape

**Overall Concept**

The website is a single, horizontally-scrolling 2D platformer level set in a minimalist, abstract "Code-Scape." The player controls a small, luminous geometric character (e.g., a pulsing orb or a sleek, simple robot) with standard keyboard controls (WASD/arrows for movement, space for jump). The entire aesthetic is clean and elegant, with a dynamic color palette and background that procedurally regenerate each day, fulfilling the "re-designed by AI" premise. The goal is to traverse the level from left to right, with each major platform or area representing one of Geva's projects.

**Initial View & Header**

Upon loading, the user sees the far left of the level. The player character is at its "spawn point." Floating in the top-left corner of the screen, rendered in a crisp, modern sans-serif font, is the primary text:

**Geva Kipper**
A software engineer at Google, building the future of AI-powered developer tools.

Below this, a smaller, slightly glowing subtitle announces the site's unique feature:
*This pixel-scape is procedurally generated by AI every 24 hours. The layout, colors, and atmosphere you see today are unique.*

The background is a multi-layered parallax environment. The furthest layer is a soft, animated gradient. The mid-layers consist of slowly drifting, abstract digital artifacts like lines of faint, unreadable code, pulsing data nodes, and geometric constellations. The daily regeneration affects the color of the gradient, the shapes of the artifacts, and the overall mood (e.g., one day it might be a dark synthwave theme with neon pinks and blues; the next a bright, "daylight" theme with soft yellows and sky blues).

**The Level and Project Sections**

The player moves right, traversing a series of floating platforms. Each "project" is a distinct, interactive island or zone that the player must reach. When the player lands on a project's main interactive element, the game world freezes, and a clean, semi-transparent modal window elegantly fades in at the center of the screen, presenting the project's details.

1.  **Project 1: GlglStats**
    *   **The Zone:** The platform is designed like a massive, undulating sound wave. In the background of this section, subtle equalizer bars pulse gently.
    *   **Interaction:** At the center of the sound wave platform is a large, spinning vinyl record icon. Touching it triggers the info modal.
    *   **Modal Content:** Titled "GlglStats," it contains the project description. Below are two distinct, clearly labeled buttons: "Explore the Data" (linking to the site) and "Watch the PyData Talk" (linking to YouTube).

2.  **Project 2: Ahuzat Dibuk**
    *   **The Zone:** The player jumps onto a platform that resembles a stylized, top-down map of city streets with glowing parking spaces.
    *   **Interaction:** An old-school, glowing parking meter stands on the platform. The player interacts with it to open the modal.
    *   **Modal Content:** Titled "Ahuzat Dibuk." It features the description and three links side-by-side: "Channel 13 News," "Mako News," and "Original Facebook Post."

3.  **Project 3: 2D Part Orienting**
    *   **The Zone:** This area is a small platforming challenge consisting of several rotating geometric shapes (a triangle, a hexagon, a complex polygon) that serve as stepping stones.
    *   **Interaction:** The final, stable platform has a glowing, animated blueprint icon. Landing here triggers the modal.
    *   **Modal Content:** Titled "2D Part Orienting." It includes the description and a single, prominent button: "View Algorithm & Code."

4.  **Project 4: The Turing Jest**
    *   **The Zone:** The platform is designed to look like a stage with a single podium. In the background of this zone, pairs of comedy/tragedy masks drift slowly.
    *   **Interaction:** On the podium is a large, interactive cartoon speech bubble with a question mark inside. Jumping into it triggers the modal.
    *   **Modal Content:** Titled "The Turing Jest." It features the description and a button that reads "Play the Arena."

5.  **Project 5: Rhymes of Israel**
    *   **The Zone:** This platform resembles a giant, curled strip of newspaper print, with nonsensical, stylized headlines visible on its surface.
    *   **Interaction:** A large, animated fountain pen is drawing a rhyming couplet in the air. Touching the tip of the pen triggers the modal.
    *   **Modal Content:** Titled "Rhymes of Israel." It includes the description and a clear call-to-action button: "Install for Chrome."

6.  **Project 6: This Portfolio**
    *   **The Zone:** A simple, minimalist platform.
    *   **Interaction:** The interactive element is a large, perfectly reflective, shimmering mirror. As the player character approaches, its glowing reflection is visible. Touching the mirror triggers the final project modal.
    *   **Modal Content:** Titled "/dev/portfolio." It contains the meta-description of the site and a single link: "View Source Loop" which links back to geekip.dev.

**End Game & Footer**

After the final project, the player reaches the end of the level. This last platform is wider and more stable.

*   **Social Links:** Three glowing portals stand at the far right edge of the platform, each embossed with a simple, clean icon for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook, respectively. Walking the character into a portal opens the corresponding link in a new tab.

*   **Credits:** Below this final platform, at the very bottom of the page, sits the footer text in a small, clean font:
    *Designed and architected by a friendly neighborhood AI. Time since last system-wide reboot:*

*   **Stopwatch:** Immediately following the text is a live, ticking digital stopwatch displaying the time elapsed since 2025-07-11 01:11:13 in an `HH:MM:SS` format, constantly updating.
