# Subway Map Portfolio Design

The page opens with a dark, slightly textured background reminiscent of a transit station wall at night (#1a1a2e with subtle concrete texture). At the top center, "GEVA KIPPER" appears in bold, LED-style luminous letters with a soft amber glow, mimicking electronic subway displays. Directly beneath, a smaller digital ticker scrolls the sentence about his current work at Google, with orange monospace text that flickers subtly like an old departure board.

Below this, a thin horizontal band in muted yellow contains the subtitle about the AI-redesigned website, set in a clean sans-serif font with a small rotating icon (∞) that pulses gently, emphasizing the ever-changing nature.

The main content area features an actual stylized subway map that sprawls across the viewport. Seven colored transit lines weave through the space, each representing a different technology domain (Python in blue, C++ in red, Web/Chrome in green, LLM/AI in purple, etc.). Each line connects circular station nodes, which are the six project boxes plus the social links box.

The station nodes are circular containers with a white outer ring (like real subway station markers), and inside each is a colored circle matching its transit line. When you hover over a station, it pulses with a gentle glow and the entire transit line brightens. The project name appears in the station circle in bold transit-style typography.

Each project box expands as a rounded-rectangle information panel that appears to "unfold" from the station marker when hovered or clicked, like a subway station information board. These panels have a semi-transparent dark background (#2d2d44 at 95% opacity) with a colored left border matching the transit line. Inside, the project title sits at the top in all-caps with an icon (🎵 for GlglStats, 🅿️ for Ahuzat Dibuk, 🔧 for 2D Part Orienting, 😄 for Turing Jest, 📰 for Rhymes of Israel, ♾️ for the meta portfolio, 👤 for social links).

The description text uses a modern geometric sans-serif in light gray (#e0e0e0). Links appear as small rounded pill-shaped buttons in the transit line's accent color with white text and a subtle arrow icon (→). Video links get a play icon (▶), news links get a newspaper icon, and code repositories get a brackets icon (</>).

The seven stations are arranged in a meandering subway map layout: GlglStats in the upper-left, Ahuzat Dibuk to its right, 2D Part Orienting at center-left, Turing Jest at center, Rhymes of Israel at center-right, the meta portfolio at lower-right, and social links as the terminal station at bottom-center. Dotted lines with small arrows show transfer points between related technologies (e.g., both Python projects connect, both LLM projects connect).

Small distance markers in circles appear along the transit lines showing "years of experience" or "complexity level" as playful subway-style annotations. Tiny train icons occasionally animate along the lines in a slow, endless loop.

At the absolute bottom, a dark footer bar styled like the bottom of a subway map features small text on the left crediting the AI model with a robot emoji (🤖) and the model name in courier font. On the right, a digital stopwatch display in the same LED-style as the header shows "Time Since Last Rebuild:" followed by the elapsed time from 2025-11-12 01:06:03, updating every second with a gentle flash animation on each tick.

The entire layout is responsive: on mobile, the subway map transforms into a vertical single-line route with stations stacked top to bottom, maintaining the same aesthetic but in a linear format. All interactive elements support both hover (desktop) and tap (mobile) with smooth CSS transitions that feel mechanical and precise, like real transit infrastructure.
