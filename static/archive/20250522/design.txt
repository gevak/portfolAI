# Circuit Board Portfolio Design for Geva Kipper

## Core Concept
A dark-themed portfolio that simulates a circuit board, with glowing traces connecting different sections. As users scroll or interact with elements, the circuit "powers up" with animated electricity flowing through the traces, illuminating different project sections.

## Header Section
- Geva Kipper's name in a futuristic, tech-inspired font that glows with a subtle blue pulse
- Subtitle: "Software Engineer at Google, creating intelligent infrastructure solutions"
- Smaller dynamic subtitle: "This website redesigns itself daily using AI - what you see is unique to today"
- Background features subtle animated circuit traces that connect to the sections below

## Layout
The single page features a vertical circuit board design with five interconnected "component modules" (project boxes) arranged in a non-linear pattern. Thin, glowing traces connect each section, with small animated "current" flowing through them as users scroll.

## Project Modules
Each project appears as a specialized "circuit component" with:
- Hexagonal or angular shapes to mimic electronic components
- A small LED indicator that glows brighter when hovered
- Circuitry traces extending from each module connecting to other sections
- When a module is in focus, the connecting traces illuminate with animated electricity flow

### Project 1: GlglStats
- Design resembles an audio waveform component
- Features a minimalist visualization of sound wave patterns
- Small animation showing compression of a repeating pattern
- Two glowing connection points for the website and video links

### Project 2: Ahuzat Dibuk
- Resembles a data processing unit with small animated heat-map visualization
- Small parking lot icons with fluctuating occupancy indicators
- News links appear as notification LEDs connecting to external media ports

### Project 3: 2D Part Orienting
- Styled as a geometric processor chip
- Features subtle animations of a polygon being oriented through pushing motions
- C++ code snippets appear as circuit etchings within the component

### Project 4: Portfolio Website
- Meta design featuring a recursive circuit board pattern
- Small mirrored version of the main site layout
- Pulsing self-referential link that creates a visual feedback effect

### Project 5: Social Links
- Designed as a communication hub component
- GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook icons arranged as integrated circuit pins
- Each social icon illuminates with its brand color when hovered

## Interactive Elements
- As users scroll, circuit traces "power up" sequentially
- Mouse movements leave a subtle electromagnetic field effect
- Clicking a project causes a power surge animation through the traces to that component
- When a project is in focus, its "component" expands slightly and increases in brightness

## Footer
- Contains credit line: "Designed by Claude AI"
- Features an LED-style digital stopwatch counting time since May 22, 2025
- The stopwatch has a circuit-board styled frame around it
- Small animated circuit traces connect the footer to the rest of the page

## Technical Details
- Glowing elements use CSS box-shadow and text-shadow effects
- Circuit traces are SVG paths with animated gradients
- Smooth scrolling transitions between sections
- Subtle tech-inspired ambient sound effects on interactions (optional, user can disable)
- Responsive design that maintains the circuit board aesthetic on all devices
