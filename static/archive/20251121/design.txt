**Visual Concept: The "Living Code" Ecosystem**

**Atmosphere and Color Palette**
The site utilizes a "Dark Mode" aesthetic to allow the Game of Life simulation to pop. The background is a deep, matte obsidian (#050505), serving as the infinite void. The "Life" cells are not merely monochrome blocks; they are bioluminescent pixels in shades of electric cyan, neon magenta, and lime green. As cells age or die within the simulation, they fade effectively into the background, creating a ghosting trail effect. The typography relies on a crisp, high-readability monospace font (e.g., JetBrains Mono or Fira Code) to emphasize the software engineering identity, rendered in stark white for contrast.

**The Interactive Background Engine**
The entire viewport serves as the canvas for a high-performance Conway’s Game of Life simulation.
*   **Cursor interaction:** The user’s cursor acts as a "Life Spawner." As the mouse moves, it leaves a trail of active cells, effectively allowing the user to "paint" life onto the screen.
*   **Physics of the UI:** The content boxes discussed below act as "solid matter" within the simulation. When the autonomous Life cells (gliders, oscillators) collide with the borders of a project box, they splatter or bounce off, causing the border of that specific card to glow briefly, simulating an energy transfer.

**Header Section**
Centered at the top is the name **Geva Kipper** in a large, bold typeface. Upon page load, the letters assemble themselves from a swarm of chaotic Life cells before solidifying. Immediately below is the professional summary: "Software Engineer at Google."
Below this is the **AI Disclaimer Subtitle**. It should look like a terminal prompt or a system notification, pulsating slightly. It reads: *"This interface is hallucinogenic—redesigned daily by AI to ensure perpetual novelty."*

**The Project Grid (The "Petri Dishes")**
The six project boxes and the social hub are arranged in a masonry-style or bento-box grid, floating above the background simulation. The cards utilize a "Shattered Glass" morphism—semi-transparent, dark-tinted backgrounds with high background blur, allowing the moving Life cells behind them to be seen as vague, moving lights.

1.  **GlglStats:**
    *   *Visual:* A subtle audio-waveform animation plays at the bottom of this card.
    *   *Content:* Title, description of the LZ77 pop-chart analysis.
    *   *Interaction:* Hovering over the "Watch Video" link causes the card to emit a rhythmic pulse of cells into the background.
    *   *Links:* Direct link to the site and the PyData YouTube video.

2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk:**
    *   *Visual:* A faint, monochrome stylized map of Tel-Aviv serves as the card's texture.
    *   *Content:* Description of the parking scraper and heat maps.
    *   *Links:* Icons linking to the Channel 13 and Mako news items, and the Facebook usage case.

3.  **2D Part Orienting:**
    *   *Visual:* Geometric minimalism. An SVG of a polygon rotates slowly in the corner of the card.
    *   *Content:* Explanation of the C++ push plan algorithm.
    *   *Links:* Link to the Tel-Aviv University project page.

4.  **The Turing Jest:**
    *   *Visual:* Split design. One side looks like a rigid robot; the other like a jester hat, merged into a single icon.
    *   *Content:* Description of the LLM pun battle arena.
    *   *Links:* Large "Play" button linking to the site.

5.  **Rhymes of Israel:**
    *   *Visual:* A classic newspaper headline font is used for the title, contrasting with the digital aesthetic.
    *   *Content:* Description of the comedic news-to-rhyme Chrome extension.
    *   *Links:* A "Download for Chrome" badge.

6.  **The Meta-Portfolio:**
    *   *Visual:* A recursive image—a small screenshot of the *current* website (this very design) is shown, creating an infinite mirror effect.
    *   *Content:* "A self-referential loop: The site you are currently viewing."
    *   *Links:* Link to `geekip.dev`.

7.  **Contact & Social Hub (The Anchor):**
    *   This box is distinct—perhaps a perfect square.
    *   It contains large, minimalist icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook.
    *   *Interaction:* When the cursor hovers here, the Game of Life simulation temporarily pauses in a radius around this box, symbolizing stability.

**Footer: The Temporal Marker**
Fixed at the very bottom of the screen is a thin status bar.
*   **Left:** "Site generated by AI Model [Model Name/Version]."
*   **Right:** A high-precision digital stopwatch. It counts up in real-time (Hours:Minutes:Seconds) counting the elapsed time since **2025-11-21 01:05:32**. The numbers flip rapidly like a mechanical departure board or a raw counter, emphasizing the passage of time in this specific generated iteration.
