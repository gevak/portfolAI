**Visual Theme and Atmosphere**
The website is designed as an infinite, draggable, and zoomable 2D CAD (Computer-Aided Design) workspace or architectural blueprint. The background consists of a deep "Blueprint Blue" (#0F172A) with a faint, isometric grid pattern in cyan (#22D3EE). The typography utilizes a monospace font (like JetBrains Mono or Fira Code) to mimic code editors and technical schematics. The cursor is replaced by a crosshair with dynamic X/Y coordinates floating next to it, updating in real-time as the user moves the mouse. All design elements appear as white and cyan vector outlines, resembling a wireframe distributed system diagram.

**Header: The Title Block**
Fixed to the top-left corner is a "Technical Drawing Title Block," stylized with heavy borders. Inside this block, the "Project Architect" is listed as **Geva Kipper**, with the description: "Software Engineer at Google // Architecting Scalable Systems." Below this, a stamped texture effect displays the subtitle: "NOTICE: This schematic is procedurally re-generated daily by AI. Status: VOLATILE." The text should flicker slightly like a CRT monitor.

**The Main Canvas: Functional Nodes**
The center of the screen features the six project "boxes," but they are designed as interconnected "Server Nodes" or "Microservice Containers" linked by animated data pipelines (lines with pulses of light moving through them). Users can drag the canvas to explore the map or use the scroll wheel to zoom in on specific nodes. Each node expands when hovered over, revealing the specific details and links.

1.  **Node A: GlglStats (The Signal Processor)**
    Designed to look like a DSP (Digital Signal Processing) unit. The background of this box features a stylized, animated frequency waveform. When hovered, the waveform syncs to a beat. The description highlights the LZ77 compression algorithm. The link to the site is styled as a "Deploy" button, and the YouTube video is embedded inside a retro-styled modal that looks like an oscilloscope screen labeled "PyData Conference Feed."

2.  **Node B: Ahuzat Dibuk (The Heatmap Sensor)**
    This node resembles a topographical map or a radar grid. The background displays a subtle, shifting heatmap of Tel Aviv. The links to the news stories (Channel 13, Mako) and the Facebook post are displayed as "External Data Source" inputs feeding into the main logic block. The visuals suggest data scraping and aggregation.

3.  **Node C: 2D Part Orienting (The Geometry Engine)**
    This box features a rotating wireframe polygon. The design mimics a computational geometry debugger. As the user hovers, the polygon attempts to "orient" itself into a push plan. The link to the CGL project is labeled "Access Source Code / C++ Library."

4.  **Node D: The Turing Jest (The Neural Cluster)**
    Designed as a neural network node with connecting synapses. The visual icon is two chat bubbles merging into a brain. The text describes the LMSYS-style arena. The link to the site is a button explicitly labeled "npx run turing-jest-arena."

5.  **Node E: Rhymes of Israel (The Injector Script)**
    This node looks like a browser window wireframe or a Chrome plugin manifest file. It features a "Rewrite" animation where headline text transforms into jagged lines (simulating handwritten rhymes). The link to the Chrome Web Store is styled as an "Install Extension" toggle switch.

6.  **Node F: The Meta-Container (Recursion)**
    This node represents the portfolio itself. It is designed as a distinct "recursive" box—visually, it contains a miniature version of the entire blueprint map that updates as the user pans around the real site. It is labeled "Self-Reference/Recursion." The link points to `geekip.dev`.

**Connectivity and Socials: The I/O Port**
Located in the bottom-right fixed corner is a panel labeled "I/O Interface." This panel contains three distinct ports representing external connections:
*   **GitHub:** An icon of a "git branch" structure.
*   **LinkedIn:** An icon of a "handshake" protocol.
*   **Facebook:** An icon of a "network node."
All links (github.com/gevak, linkedin.com/in/gevakip, facebook.com/geva.kipper) open in new tabs but trigger a "Connection Establish..." animation on the blueprint lines when clicked.

**Footer: System Uptime**
Fixed to the absolute bottom center is a terminal-style status bar. It reads: "System Architecture generated by AI Model [Your Model Name]." Next to it is a running uptime counter labeled "RUNWTIME_SINCE_EPOCH [2026-01-20T01:12:50]." The counter ticks up in Hours:Minutes:Seconds with millisecond precision, giving the impression that the portfolio is a live, running server instance initiated on that specific future date.
