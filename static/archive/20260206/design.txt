# Matrix Rain Portfolio — Design Description

## Overall Concept

The entire page opens with a full-screen Matrix-style digital rain animation — columns of falling green characters (a mix of katakana, Latin letters, and digits) cascading downward on a pure black background. After approximately three seconds, the falling characters begin to decelerate and drift laterally, clustering together as if magnetically attracted to invisible scaffolding. They assemble — character by character, like iron filings snapping to a magnet — into the readable text and UI elements of the portfolio. Once assembled, the characters settle into place but retain a subtle, continuous shimmer: individual glyphs randomly flicker to alternate characters for a single frame before returning, so the entire page perpetually looks alive, as though the content could dissolve back into rain at any moment. A very faint, slow rain of dimmed green characters continues falling in the deep background behind all content for the lifetime of the page, ensuring the Matrix atmosphere never fully disappears.

## Color Palette and Typography

The background is a deep true black (#000000). The primary text color is a bright phosphor green (#00FF41), with highlights and hover states in a lighter electric white-green (#7DFDAA). Secondary text and descriptions use a muted green-grey (#4A7A5A). All section borders and divider lines are rendered as a dim green (#1A3A1A) that brightens to full phosphor green on hover. The primary typeface is a monospace font — Source Code Pro or Fira Code with ligatures enabled — reinforcing the hacker-terminal aesthetic. The developer's name uses a heavier weight of the same monospace family, slightly tracked out. No serif or sans-serif fonts appear anywhere; everything stays in the monospace family to maintain the illusion that the entire site is a living terminal readout.

## Header Area

At the top of the page, centered, the name **GEVA KIPPER** appears in large monospace capitals (roughly 4rem). Each letter has a faint vertical glow trail above it, as though each character just fell into place from the rain. Beneath the name, a single line in a smaller size reads his current role at Google — something like "Software Engineer at Google" — styled in the muted green-grey with a slow, gentle opacity pulse so it looks like a blinking terminal cursor line. Below that, separated by a thin horizontal glowing green line that draws itself from center outward, is the subtitle explaining the site is redesigned daily by AI. This line is styled in italic monospace with a slightly amber-shifted green (#80FF80), and it includes a small animated infinity symbol (∞) slowly rotating beside it, suggesting perpetual change. The subtitle text itself has a very slow character-by-character rewrite animation on a long loop — every 20 seconds or so, the text dissolves letter by letter back into random Matrix characters and then reassembles, as if being regenerated.

## Section Cards Layout

Below the header, the six project sections plus the links section (seven total) are arranged in a responsive grid: three columns on desktop, two on tablet, one on mobile. Each section is a rectangular card with a thin single-pixel border in dim green. The interior of each card is not pure black but very slightly lighter (#050505) to create just enough contrast to distinguish the card from the infinite background. Each card has a subtle scanline overlay — thin horizontal lines at 2px intervals with very low opacity — to give a CRT monitor feel.

When a card enters the viewport during scroll, it doesn't simply fade in — instead, a miniature localized rain of green characters falls within the card's bounding box for about one second, and then those characters rearrange and snap into the actual content text of the card, mirroring the opening animation but in miniature and scoped to each card individually.

## Card Interactivity

On hover, each card's border brightens to full phosphor green and gains a soft green box-shadow glow (0 0 15px rgba(0,255,65,0.3)). The card also shifts upward by a few pixels. The background of the hovered card gets an animated rain effect — a very faint, slow stream of tiny characters falling behind the text, visible only inside that card. When the cursor leaves, the glow fades and the micro-rain dissipates over half a second.

## Section 1 — GlglStats

The card title "GlglStats" is displayed at the top in bright green with a small music-note icon (♪) rendered in monospace beside it. Below the title, a two-line description explains it is a Python project measuring repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression and visualizing repetition patterns of famous songs. Beneath the description, there is a small embedded or thumbnail-style representation of the YouTube talk: a dark rectangle styled to look like a terminal video player with a green play-triangle icon in the center and the text "PyData TLV Talk" below it, linking to the YouTube URL. Next to or below this, a green underlined link labeled "[→ Explore GlglStats]" points to glglstats.geekip.dev. The links have a typewriter-cursor blink on the arrow character.

## Section 2 — Ahuzat Dibuk

Title "Ahuzat Dibuk" with a small car/parking icon (🅿 rendered in green monospace style). Description explains it as a Python scraping and data visualization project collecting Tel-Aviv parking lot occupancy statistics and generating heatmaps for residents. Below the description, three links are listed vertically, each prefixed with a green bracket-arrow prompt style like a terminal command list:  
`> Channel 13 News Coverage` → linking to 13tv.co.il URL  
`> Mako News Coverage` → linking to mako.co.il URL  
`> Original Post (Facebook)` → linking to the Facebook group post  
Each link highlights with a brighter glow and a brief "scanning" animation (a horizontal green line sweeps left to right across the link text) on hover.

## Section 3 — 2D Part Orienting

Title "2D Part Orienting" with a small geometric shape icon — a simple polygon outline drawn in green CSS/SVG that slowly rotates in place. Description explains it as a C++ implementation in an open-source computational geometry library of an efficient algorithm for constructing a push plan to orient a given polygon. A single link `[→ Project & Code]` points to the TAU CGL project page. As a decorative touch, a tiny animated SVG polygon in the corner of this card is being "pushed" and slowly rotating to a target orientation, looping every few seconds — a subtle visual nod to the algorithm's purpose.

## Section 4 — The Turing Jest

Title "The Turing Jest" with a small comedy masks or laughing emoji icon styled in green. Description explains it as an LMSYS-style arena where LLMs compete at making and explaining puns, with answers rated by users. Link: `[→ Enter the Arena]` pointing to jest.geekip.dev. A fun decorative detail: beneath the description, two short lines of text appear in alternating animation, styled as if two competing LLMs are each delivering a one-liner pun, with a small ⭐ rating animation flickering between them — purely decorative flavor text that loops.

## Section 5 — Rhymes of Israel

Title "Rhymes of Israel" with a small Chrome icon outline rendered in green monospace ASCII art or a simple SVG. Description explains it as a Chrome extension that uses an LLM to rewrite Israeli news headlines into comedic rhymes in the style of a high school yearbook. Link: `[→ Install Extension]` pointing to the Chrome Web Store URL. A small decorative animation shows a fake one-line "headline" in plain text that dissolves and rewrites itself into a rhyming version, looping through two or three examples — all fictional and lighthearted — to demonstrate the concept visually.

## Section 6 — This Portfolio Site (Meta)

Title "geekip.dev" with a small recursive/fractal icon or a mirror emoji (🪞) in green. Description playfully acknowledges the meta-nature: this is the portfolio website itself, redesigned daily by AI, an ever-changing artifact. Link: `[→ You are here]` pointing to geekip.dev. On click, instead of navigating away, the entire page triggers the full Matrix rain dissolution and reassembly animation — the whole site melts back into falling characters and reforms, as if the page has been "regenerated." This card's border has a special double-line style to visually distinguish it as the self-referential entry.

## Section 7 — Social Links

This final card is styled slightly differently — it has no title, or a minimal one like "Connect" or simply three slashes `///`. Inside, three social links are displayed as large, horizontally-centered monospace text blocks stacked vertically:  
`[GitHub]` → github.com/gevak  
`[LinkedIn]` → linkedin.com/in/gevakip  
`[Facebook]` → facebook.com/geva.kipper  
Each link is rendered as a green terminal-style button — a rectangle drawn with box-drawing characters (╔══╗ style borders) around the label. On hover, each button fills with a quick cascade of Matrix rain characters inside its boundaries before the text snaps back into readability, as if the button itself briefly glitched.

## Footer

Below all cards, after generous spacing, a thin horizontal green line draws itself across the width of the page. Beneath it, centered, in small muted green text, is the AI credit line — something like "Designed by Claude (Anthropic) · [current date]" — acknowledging the AI model that created the design. The text is humble and small, in the dimmest green tone used on the site.

Directly below the credit, a monospace stopwatch counts upward in real time, displaying hours, minutes, and seconds elapsed since 2026-02-06 01:25:00 UTC. The format is `HH:MM:SS` or a more dramatic `DDDDD:HH:MM:SS` if days are included, styled like a terminal clock with each digit individually animated — when a digit changes, it briefly flickers through several random Matrix characters before settling on the new number. The stopwatch glows slightly brighter than surrounding text, with a soft green pulse on each second tick.

## Scrolling and Motion

As the user scrolls down, the background rain columns subtly shift in parallax — they fall slightly slower than the scroll speed, creating a gentle depth illusion as if the content floats above the rain. The green glow from card borders reflects faintly into the rain immediately surrounding each card, as though the cards are physical monitors illuminating the falling code near them.

A thin, vertical, glowing green scrollbar replaces the browser default — styled as a single bright green line on the right edge of the viewport, with a small blinking cursor-block as the thumb.

## Responsive Behavior

On mobile, the grid collapses to a single column. The initial full-screen rain animation is shorter (two seconds) to respect mobile performance. The background rain density is reduced to fewer columns. Card hover effects become tap effects — tapping a card triggers the glow and micro-rain briefly. The header name scales down but retains its glow trails. The stopwatch in the footer remains fully functional and legible.

## Performance Considerations

The Matrix rain is rendered on a single HTML5 canvas element positioned fixed behind all content, running at a capped 30fps to conserve resources. Card-level micro-rain animations use CSS animations with transforms and opacity rather than additional canvas layers. The initial assembly animation uses requestAnimationFrame with character position interpolation. All glow effects use CSS box-shadow and text-shadow rather than filter: blur for better performance. The shimmer/flicker effect on settled text is achieved with a lightweight JavaScript interval that randomly toggles characters in a sparse subset of text nodes, affecting only 1-2% of characters at any given frame.
