# OS-Inspired Portfolio Design: Geva Kipper's Digital Workspace

## Core Design Concept
A sleek, nostalgic yet modern desktop operating system interface where the entire portfolio exists within a simulated computer environment. The background features a subtle gradient with abstract code patterns that occasionally animate softly.

## Header
A top menu bar displays "GevaOS v1.0" on the left, with the current date/time on the right. Below this in large, modern typography: "Geva Kipper" with a subtitle noting "Currently Engineering at Google" and a smaller italicized text: "This website redesigns itself daily through AI - what you see is unique to today."

## Main Interface
The desktop contains five application icons with appropriate visual metaphors:
- üìä GlglStats
- üÖøÔ∏è Ahuzat Dibuk
- üîÑ 2D Part Orienting
- üñ•Ô∏è Portfolio Meta
- üë§ Connect

Clicking any icon opens a draggable, resizable window with a title bar featuring minimize, maximize, and close buttons. Windows can overlap, be brought to front when clicked, and be arranged freely.

## Window Contents
Each project window contains:
1. **GlglStats Window**: Split view with music visualization animation on left, project details on right. Embedded video thumbnail with play button. Prominent link to live project site.

2. **Ahuzat Dibuk Window**: Heatmap visualization as the background with text overlay. News coverage links appear as "press clippings" that slightly tilt when hovered. Facebook post shown as a social media frame.

3. **2D Part Orienting Window**: Interactive demo showing a polygon being oriented through pushes. Code snippets appear in a terminal-like section below. Link to full project.

4. **Portfolio Meta Window**: Self-referential design showing an infinite mirror effect of nested portfolio websites. Clicking reveals the actual link.

5. **Connect Window**: Three circular social media icons that expand when hovered, revealing the platform names. Clicking opens the respective profiles in a new tab.

## Interactive Elements
- Windows cast subtle shadows when dragged
- Minimize sends windows to a taskbar at bottom
- Maximize fills the screen with that window
- All windows can be rearranged, resized with corner handles
- Desktop right-click opens a context menu with "About" option

## Footer
A system tray at the bottom displays "Designed by [AI Model Name]" and a running stopwatch showing precise time elapsed since April 15, 2025, 01:03:59 in hours:minutes:seconds, updating in real-time.

## Responsive Design
On mobile devices, the OS transforms into a mobile OS interface with swipeable app screens instead of windows, maintaining the core aesthetic while optimizing for touch.
