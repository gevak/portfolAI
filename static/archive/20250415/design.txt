Okay, here is the design description for the pixel world portfolio website:

**Overall Concept:**

The website is a single, vertically scrolling page presenting a minimalist pixel art world. The initial view establishes the scene, and scrolling down might reveal slightly more of this small world or simply provide vertical space. The primary interaction involves exploring this miniature pixel landscape where specific elements represent Geva's projects and links. The aesthetic is clean pixel art – think modern indie game rather than retro chunky pixels – with a limited, elegant color palette that subtly shifts daily.

**Header Section:**

*   **Top of Page:** Geva Kipper's name displayed prominently in a clean, readable sans-serif font, perhaps with a very subtle pixelation effect applied via CSS if it doesn't harm readability.
*   **Directly Below Name:** A single, concise sentence: "Software Engineer at Google, focusing on [mention brief area if allowed/desired, otherwise just 'Software Engineer at Google']."
*   **Subtitle:** Below the role description, in a slightly smaller font size: "This portfolio is reconstructed by AI daily, offering an ever-evolving digital landscape." Maybe add a tiny, animated pixelated brain or gear icon next to this text.

**Main Content: The Pixel World**

Imagine a small, serene isometric or slightly top-down pixel art landscape occupying the central part of the screen. It's not overly cluttered. Key interactive elements are clearly distinguishable. The background could be a simple gradient or a very clean pixel sky/ground.

1.  **GlglStats Representation:** A miniature pixelated building resembling a radio station or recording studio. Subtle pixelated musical notes animate rising from its antenna. Hovering over it causes the notes to pulse slightly, and a tooltip appears: "GlglStats". Clicking opens a modal window.
    *   **Modal Content:** Clean layout. Title: "GlglStats". Description: "Python project measuring Israeli pop-chart song repetitiveness using LZ77 compression, with visualizations of patterns." Buttons/Links clearly labelled: "Visit GlglStats Site", "Watch PyData Presentation".
2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk Representation:** A small pixelated parking lot area with a few tiny cars. A pixelated heat-map pattern could be subtly overlaid on the ground texture of the lot. Hovering highlights the heat-map or makes a tiny pixelated sign flash. Tooltip: "Ahuzat Dibuk". Clicking opens a modal.
    *   **Modal Content:** Title: "Ahuzat Dibuk". Description: "Python scraping & data visualization project analyzing Tel-Aviv parking occupancy, generating heat-maps for residents." Links: "News: Channel 13", "News: Mako", "Original Facebook Post".
3.  **2D Part Orienting Representation:** A small pixelated workshop or abstract geometric structure. Perhaps a simple pixel polygon shape being manipulated by a tiny pixelated robotic arm or pushers. Hovering causes the arm/pushers to animate subtly. Tooltip: "2D Part Orienting". Clicking opens a modal.
    *   **Modal Content:** Title: "2D Part Orienting". Description: "C++ implementation of an efficient algorithm for constructing 'push plans' to orient polygons, contributed to an open-source computational geometry library." Link: "View Project Details & Code".
4.  **Meta Portfolio Representation:** A pixelated easel standing within the world, displaying a tiny, simplified pixel version of the portfolio site itself. Hovering makes the easel glow slightly. Tooltip: "This Portfolio". Clicking opens a modal (or perhaps just triggers a brief,confirming animation/effect as the link points to the current page).
    *   **Modal Content (or alternative interaction):** Title: "Pixel Portfolio". Description: "This website! A single-page application showcasing projects within an interactive pixel world, designed by AI." Link: "View Live Site" (linking to the current URL).
5.  **Social Links Representation:** A clean, modern pixelated signpost or a small info kiosk structure within the world. It features tiny, recognizable pixel icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Hovering over the structure highlights the icons. Clicking the *structure itself* opens a single modal containing all social links.
    *   **Modal Content:** Title: "Connect". Description: "Find me online:". Links clearly labelled with icons: "GitHub", "LinkedIn", "Facebook".

**Footer Section:**

*   **Bottom Left:** Small text: "Site concept & design generated by [Your AI Model Name, e.g., Claude 3 Opus]."
*   **Bottom Right:** A dynamic stopwatch displaying "Time Since Daily Redesign:" followed by a counter showing Hours:Minutes:Seconds elapsed since 2025-04-15 14:10:03 GMT (ensure timezone clarity or use UTC). This counter actively updates using JavaScript.

**Animation & Styling Notes:**

*   Use subtle CSS animations for hover effects (pulsing, glowing, slight movement) – keep it smooth and unobtrusive.
*   Modal windows should appear smoothly (e.g., fade-in/scale-up) and have a clean, minimalist design consistent with the overall aesthetic. A semi-transparent overlay behind the modal can help focus attention.
*   The "AI redesigned daily" aspect can be visualized subtly: maybe the primary accent color of the pixel world (e.g., the color of the musical notes, the parking sign flash, the easel glow) changes each day based on a deterministic function of the date. The layout of minor decorative elements (e.g., pixel trees, clouds) could also shift slightly.
*   Ensure responsiveness: On smaller screens, the pixel world might need to simplify or stack elements differently, or the view could zoom in slightly. Modals must adapt gracefully to screen size.
