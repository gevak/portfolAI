The site opens with a dark, softly textured background resembling neural connections or gently swirling fog, setting a mysterious, modern mood. At the center, Geva Kipper’s name is set in large, white geometric sans-serif, with a subtle glow. Directly beneath, a single sentence in a distinct yet understated italic explains: “Currently building intuitive data platforms at Google, using ML to turn real-world signals into insights.” 

A lively subtitle appears below, morphing dynamically via a typewriter or dissolve effect: “This portfolio is redesigned daily by AI—it’s never the same twice.” The subtitle fades to semi-transparency as you interact with the page.

Instead of traditional navigation, the entire content is visualized as an interactive, animated mind map. Five softly rounded, colored nodes (“clusters”) orbit Geva’s name, each connected by gently pulsating lines. On wide screens, the clusters are arranged in a slightly asymmetric, organic constellation; on mobile, the nodes reorganize vertically, maintaining lines and interactive flow.

Each cluster represents a project/section. Nodes gently shift outward upon hover, with subtle color shifts, evoking an intelligent, living network. Clicking or tapping a node smoothly zooms and pans the viewport, spotlighting the cluster at the center, causing all other nodes to fade back and the lines to regroup, revealing a box (“cluster zoom”) with animated expansion. A subtle parallax or glassmorphism effect adds depth behind the expanded cluster.

**Clusters:**
1. **GlglStats** — Icon: interlocked musical notes, animated gently pulsing. The zoom reveals a minimalist card: left, a looping waveform visualization background; center, project summary in two compact lines (“A Python project exploring Israeli pop-song repetitiveness using LZ77 compression and visualization.”). To the right, two interactive elements: a bold button linking to the live site, and an embedded, muted video preview with rounded corners and a play overlay that launches the full PyData TLV presentation in a modal.
2. **Ahuzat Dibuk** — Icon: a map pin with nested circular heat-rings. The expanded view shows a crisp city map snippet, color-coded, fading out toward the edges. Box text: “Scraping and mapping real-time Tel-Aviv parking lot data so residents find a spot—for less stress, less circling.” Inline: three minimal icon-links to news articles, popping open on hover; below that, a blue Facebook logo linking to the original post.
3. **2D Part Orienting** — Icon: a rotating polygon with push arrows animated subtly. Upon zoom, the background is a minimal SVG mesh, evoking computational geometry. Description: “Open-source C++ for efficient polygon orienting, part of a global geometry toolkit.” Fancy minimal code icon links out to the project site.
4. **Portfolio Site (meta!)** — Icon: paperclip and infinity symbol melding, animated with a slight ripple. The cluster zoom shows a mirrored “window” preview of the current mind map, alongside the line: “This site redesigns itself; here’s the original version I spun off from…” and a neat compact link to the reference site.
5. **Contact** — Icon: three overlapping points connected (“connections”) with their logos: GitHub, LinkedIn, Facebook. When expanded, the box becomes a minimalist card with clickable buttons (monochrome on hover) linking to Geva’s social profiles. A luminous, slightly blurred background pulse draws user focus here as the “exit” node.

Cross-zooming between clusters is seamless, with a gentle camera movement and animated lines reconfiguring in real time. Each cluster can be closed to return to the overview.

All interactions are frictionless, using spring-based or spline motion, with subtle sound design (swishes, light pops, maybe musical notes for GlglStats) for extra immersion, but fully muted by default.

In the lower center/left (fixed), small text reads:  
“Designed and generated by OpenAI’s GPT-4, inspired by Geva’s daily flux.”  
On the right, a live, elegant stopwatch counts up precisely since 2025-04-15 04:38:36; the digits use a mono/tech font, glowing softly against the background.

Typography follows a single, clean modern font family (e.g., Inter, Poppins), with occasional italics for emphasis. Color scheme uses deep slate, midnight blue, off-white, with each cluster node accented by a distinctive but low-saturation highlight.  

The overall experience is of an intelligent mind at work: minimal, functional, endlessly explorable, visually fresh—an elegant digital map of a creative journey, and a daily-evolving self-portrait.
