**Visual Style and Atmosphere**
The aesthetic is "Futuristic Glassmorphism." The background is a deep, animated mesh gradient (midnight blue, neon purple, and electric teal) that moves slowly to imply a living system. The UI elements—windows, taskbar, and icons—feature a frosted glass effect (backdrop-filter: blur) with thin, semi-transparent white borders and subtle drop shadows to create depth. The typography uses a monospaced font like 'JetBrains Mono' or 'Fira Code' for headers to emphasize the engineering theme, paired with a clean sans-serif like 'Inter' for body text for readability.

**The Desktop Interface (Main Layout)**
The screen functions as a literal desktop. Upon loading, there is no scroll bar. Instead, icons tempt the user to click, or windows are pre-opened in a cascaded arrangement.
*   **The "System Widget" (Top Left):** A floating, borderless widget displaying "Geva Kipper" in large, bold text. Below it, a status indicator (green dot) with the text: "Software Engineer @ Google." Underneath, a glitch-text animation effect cycles through the subtitle: "Interface re-generated daily by AI."
*   **The Dock (Bottom Center):** A floating macOS-style dock containing icons for the six project boxes plus a "Social" folder. Hovering over icons causes magnification.
*   **The System Tray (Bottom Right):** A pill-shaped container holding the "AI System Clock." It displays a running stopwatch counter labeled "System Uptime" measuring time elapsed since 2026-02-04 01:24:24. Next to it, a small badge reads: "Site generated by AI Model."

**The Window System (Project Cards)**
Each project opens as a draggable, resizable window. The windows have a custom title bar with "Close," "Minimize," and "Expand" circles (colored neon red, yellow, green). The active window always jumps to the highest z-index (front) with a glowing border effect.

**Window 1: GlglStats (The Data Analyzer)**
*   **Icon:** A vinyl record merged with a bar chart.
*   **Window Content:** Split layout. The left side features a looping, silent preview of the PyData TLV YouTube talk. The right side displays a snippet of the Python compression code with syntax highlighting.
*   **Footer:** Two distinct buttons: "Launch App" (links to glglstats.geekip.dev) and "Watch Full Talk" (links to YouTube).

**Window 2: Ahuzat Dibuk (The Urban Mapper)**
*   **Icon:** A location pin inside a car silhouette.
*   **Window Content:** The background of this window is a dimmed heatmap of Tel Aviv. Overlaying text describes the parking scraping project.
*   **Footer:** A "Press Coverage" section with small logos/links for Channel 13 and Mako, and a "Community Source" link to the original Facebook Secret Tel Aviv post.

**Window 3: 2D Part Orienting (The Geometry Engine)**
*   **Icon:** A complex polygon rotating inside a gear.
*   **Window Content:** A minimalist canvas drawing. An animated SVG polygon creates a "push plan" path loop to visualize the algorithm. The description highlights the C++ implementation.
*   **Footer:** A "View Source & Docs" button linking to the project page.

**Window 4: The Turing Jest (The LLM Arena)**
*   **Icon:** A robot laughing (emoji style).
*   **Window Content:** Styled like a chat interface (iMessage/WhatsApp style bubbles). One bubble contains a setup, the other a pun punchline generated by the "AI." The user can click a "Rate" button, which triggers a CSS animation of rising stars.
*   **Footer:** A large CTA button: "Enter the Arena" linking to jest.geekip.dev.

**Window 5: Rhymes of Israel (The Extension)**
*   **Icon:** A Chrome browser logo wearing a poet’s beret.
*   **Window Content:** A before-and-after toggle. "Before" shows a serious Hebrew news headline; "After" transforms it into a whimsical rhyme with a handwritten font style, simulating the extension's effect.
*   **Footer:** An "Add to Chrome" button linking to the Web Store.

**Window 6: Recursive Portfolio (The Meta Link)**
*   **Icon:** An infinity symbol loop.
*   **Window Content:** This window contains an iframe or a screenshot of the *current* desktop view, creating a Droste effect (picture within a picture). The text explains: "You are here. A self-referential loop."
*   **Footer:** A button labeled "Reload Matrix" linking to geekip.dev.

**The Social "start_menu.exe"**
*   **Icon:** Located in the Dock as a "Connect" terminal icon.
*   **Window Content:** When clicked, it opens a small, terminal-styled window.
*   **Content:** ASCII art of Geva’s initials. Below, command-line prompts act as links:
    *   `> git remote add origin github.com/gevak` (Clickable)
    *   `> connect --user linkedin.com/in/gevakip` (Clickable)
    *   `> network join facebook.com/geva.kipper` (Clickable)
