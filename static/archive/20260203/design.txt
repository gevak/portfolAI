**Visual Concept & Atmosphere**
The website is an immersive, single-page experience built upon a distinct "Liquid Code" aesthetic. The background is not a static color, but a dark, deep obsidian canvas (#0a0a12) simulating a viscous fluid container. Suspended within this fluid are thousands of glowing, neon-colored code syntax particles—curly braces `{}`, semi-colons `;`, Python `def` keywords, C++ pointers `*`, and arrow functions `=>`. These particles behave like liquid molecules; they flow gently on their own but react dynamically to the user’s cursor, swirling, dispersing, and coalescing like ink in water or bioluminescent plankton disturbed by a wave. The overall vibe is "Cyber-Organic"—technological but fluid.

**Header & Typography**
At the visual center, floating slightly above the fluid depth, is the title "Geva Kipper" rendered in a bold, crisp sans-serif font (e.g., Inter or Roboto) with a subtle glowing aura. Directly beneath, in a lighter weight, is the sentence: "Software Engineer at Google." Below that, a glitch-styled subtitle flickers occasionally: "This interface is designed daily by AI; the liquid state is ever-changing." The text is white, providing high contrast against the dark, moving background. The cursor acts as a physics attractor/repellor; moving the mouse near the name causes the background code particles to magnetically snap briefly into the shape of the letters before dissolving back into the abyss.

**The Project Grid (Glassmorphism Containers)**
The six project sections are presented not as flat squares, but as semi-transparent "Glassmorphism" panes floating in the code-liquid. These panes feature a frosted glass effect (backdrop-blur), thin 1px white-alpha borders, and soft drop shadows to create depth, making them look like heads-up display (HUD) windows suspended in the fluid. On hover, the specific card glows brighter, and the fluid simulation behind that specific card accelerates, creating a "boiling" effect.

*   **Card 1: GlglStats:** The card features a miniature, abstract visualization of audio waves compressing and expanding. It includes the title, the description regarding LZ77 compression and Israeli pop charts, and two distinct pill-shaped buttons: "View Visualization" (linking to glglstats.geekip.dev) and "Watch PyData Talk" (linking to YouTube).
*   **Card 2: Ahuzat Dibuk:** This card has a subtle background gradient shifting between red and green, mimicking a heat map. The text describes the Tel-Aviv parking scraper. Links include "News Coverage 13TV," "News Coverage Mako," and "Original Facebook Post."
*   **Card 3: 2D Part Orienting:** The graphic motif here involves geometric polygons slowly rotating behind the text. It describes the C++ push plan algorithm. A single "View Project & Code" button links to the TAU project page.
*   **Card 4: The Turing Jest:** The card frames the text like a chat interface or an LLM prompt window. It describes the pun-competition arena. The call-to-action button reads "Enter the Arena" linking to jest.geekip.dev.
*   **Card 5: Rhymes of Israel:** The typography here is playful, perhaps slightly bouncy on hover. It explains the Chrome extension for rhyming news headlines. A button labeled "Add to Chrome" links to the web store.
*   **Card 6: Portfolio (Meta):** This card creates a visual "infinity mirror" effect (Droste effect) where the icon is a tiny version of the website itself. Text explains the self-reference. The button "Visit GeekIP" links to geekip.dev.

**Social & Contact Section**
Beneath the grid, three circular magnetic buttons float horizontally. They contain the icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Unlike standard buttons, these have "liquid physics"—if you throw your mouse cursor at them fast, they bounce and wobble as if floating on water.

**Footer & Stopwatch**
The bottom of the page features a minimalist footer. It states: "Site architecture and design generated by AI Model." Below this, a monospaced, retro-digital stopwatch display is anchored. It calculates the precise duration from the timestamp **2026-02-03 01:28:35**. 
*Note regarding the timestamp:* Since this date is in the future relative to current real-time, the design should treat this as a "Time Remaining" countdown or a "Time Dilation" counter that counts up into negative values (or positive if viewed after that date), styled in a stark, terminal-green font to indicate precision.

**Technical Interactions**
*   **Scroll:** Parallax effects should be applied to the glass cards; they move at slightly different speeds than the background fluid to enhance the 3D depth perception.
*   **Responsiveness:** On mobile, the fluid simulation simplifies to conserve battery, and the glass panes stack vertically in a clean column.
*   **Color Palette:** Deep Void Black (#050505), Bioluminescent Blue (#00f3ff), Syntax Green (#00ff41), and Error Red (#ff0055) for accents.
