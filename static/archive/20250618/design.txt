### Portfolio Design: "The Terminal"

**Overall Aesthetics:** The design is an ultra-minimalistic, modern interpretation of a classic command-line terminal. It occupies the full screen with a dark, deep charcoal background (#1a1a1a) and a monospaced font (like Fira Code or Source Code Pro) in a soft, off-white (#e0e0e0). Accent colors for links and highlights are a vibrant, electric cyan (#00ffff) and a warm magenta (#ff00ff). The entire experience is contained within a single, non-scrolling viewport that emulates a terminal window, where content is generated by user commands.

**Initial View & Header:** Upon loading, the page displays a "boot-up" sequence. ASCII art of the initials "GK" quickly renders and fades, followed by a few lines that type out automatically:
```
Initializing Geva Kipper OS...
Verifying AI daily design parameters... OK
System ready.
```
This sequence disappears, leaving the main header text typed out, as if it's a welcome message:

`Geva Kipper // Software Engineer at Google, focusing on large-scale data infrastructure.`
`[This site's design is regenerated daily by an AI. All content is ephemeral.]`

Below this, a blinking cursor awaits input next to a classic prompt:
`portfolio@geva:~$ _`

**Core Interaction & Command System:** The user interacts with the site by typing commands into the prompt and pressing Enter. Invalid commands return a simple `command not found: [command]`. The core commands are:
*   **`help`**: Displays a neatly formatted, two-column list of available commands and their functions.
*   **`ls`**: Lists the available project identifiers: `glglstats`, `ahuzat-dibuk`, `2d-part-orienting`, `meta-portfolio`.
*   **`show <project_name>`**: This is the main command. When a user types, for example, `show glglstats`, the previous text on the "screen" remains, and a new content block is rendered directly below the command line. This gives the feeling of a cumulative terminal history.
*   **`connect`**: Renders the social media links section.
*   **`clear`**: Wipes all generated content from the screen, returning to the initial header and a fresh prompt.

**Project Sections (Content Blocks):** Each content block generated by the `show` command is not plain text but a styled card with a subtle, glowing cyan border. It features a clear title, a description, and interactive links.

1.  **GlglStats Block:**
    `--- Project: GlglStats ---`
    `A Python project measuring the repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression. Includes visualizations of repetition patterns in famous songs.`

2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk Block:**
    `--- Project: Ahuzat Dibuk ---`
    `A Python scraping and data visualization project that collects and analyzes Tel-Aviv parking lot occupancy, generating predictive heat-maps for residents.`

3.  **2D Part Orienting Block:**
    `--- Project: 2D Part Orienting ---`
    `A C++ implementation of an efficient algorithm for constructing a 'push plan' to orient a given polygon, contributed to an open-source computational geometry library.`
    `> [Project Details & Code](https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/)`

4.  **Portfolio Website Block:**
    `--- Project: Meta Portfolio ---`
    `The very terminal you are using now. A single-page portfolio designed as an interactive command-line interface, built with modern web technologies.`
    `> [Inspect Source (self-reference)](https://portfolio-dor1.onrender.com/)`

5.  **Connect Block:**
    `--- Connect ---`
    `Find me on the web:`
    `> [GitHub](github.com/gevak)`
    `> [LinkedIn](linkedin.com/in/gevakip)`
    `> [Facebook](facebook.com/geva.kipper)`
    Each link in these blocks is highlighted in the magenta accent color and brightens on hover, making them clearly interactive.

**Footer Elements:** A static footer is fixed to the bottom of the viewport, styled in a smaller, slightly dimmer font to separate it from the interactive terminal area.
*   On the bottom-left: `Design generated by OpenAI's GPT-4.`
*   On the bottom-right: A live stopwatch displaying the time elapsed since the specified date. It reads: `System Uptime: [HH:MM:SS]` and updates every second.
