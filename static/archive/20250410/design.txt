# "Debug to Proceed" Portfolio Design

## Core Concept
A minimalist, elegant portfolio that appears broken at first glance. Visitors encounter intentional "bugs" they must solve to reveal content. Each section is locked behind a different debugging challenge, making the portfolio itself an interactive demonstration of problem-solving skills.

## Layout & Visual Design
- Clean white background with dark monospace typography and strategic pops of color (particularly syntax highlighting colors)
- Console-style header with blinking cursor and command line aesthetic
- Error messages styled like IDE notifications (red for errors, yellow for warnings, green for success)
- Content revealed with animations mimicking code compilation or execution

## Entry Experience
The site loads with a simulated crash screen showing "FATAL ERROR" and cryptic stack trace. A small tooltip hints "Debug to continue." Visitors must open browser dev tools and follow console instructions to "fix" the site.

## Header Section
Once "debugged," reveals:
- Name "Geva Kipper" in large monospace font with a terminal-style blinking cursor
- Single sentence about current work at Google appears as if being typed
- Subtitle explaining AI-generated redesign appears with a timestamp of last update
- Mini terminal window showing the "fixed bug" that allowed entry

## Navigation
Instead of traditional links, visitors must "unlock" each project section by solving a small coding challenge or debugging task. Each solved challenge reveals the corresponding project box.

## Project Boxes
Each project box appears as a code editor window with:
- Project name as commented header
- Description formatted as code documentation
- Links styled as function calls (e.g., `openLink("https://glglstats.onrender.com/")`)
- Mini console that shows success message when section is unlocked
- Custom animation/interaction relevant to each project (e.g., audio visualization for GlglStats)

## Bug Challenges (one per section)
1. GlglStats: Fix a simple regex pattern to unlock
2. Ahuzat Dibuk: Complete missing code in a scraping function
3. 2D Part Orienting: Drag geometric shapes into correct orientations
4. Portfolio: Fix a recursive reference bug in the console
5. Social Links: Decode a simple cipher to reveal the links

## Bottom Section
- Credits line showing "Designed by [AI Model Name]" with a terminal timestamp
- Stopwatch counting time since 2025-04-10 02:39:15 in a console-style display
- Easter egg: typing "help" anywhere on the page reveals additional commands

## Responsive Design
Scales gracefully to mobile with alternative touch-friendly "debug" experiences that don't require desktop dev tools, such as shaking the device or tapping in a specific pattern.

## Dark Mode
Site detects system preferences and offers dark/light mode toggle styled as a power switch.
