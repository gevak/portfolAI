**Global Atmosphere & Utility**
The website simulates a pitch-black digital workspace or "dark room" utilizing a `canvas` element or a full-screen `div` overlay. The default state of the page is near-total darkness (hex #050505), evoking the feeling of exploring a server room or a developer's mind at night. The font selection should be a high-precision monospaced typeface (e.g., *JetBrains Mono*, *Space Mono*, or *Fira Code*) in a stark white or terminal-green color, but rendered with very low opacity (10%) when not illuminated.

**The "Flashlight" Interaction**
The core navigation mechanic is the user's cursor. Attached to the mouse coordinates is a dynamic CSS/JavaScript "flashlight"—a radial gradient mask that reveals the content beneath at 100% opacity. This shouldn't be a simple hard-edged circle; give it a soft, vignetted glow (simulating light diffusion) and a slight lag in movement to give the light "weight."
*   **Physics:** Elements closer to the center of the light source should appear brighter.
*   **Shadows:** As the light moves, the HTML "cards" (the project boxes) should cast long, dynamic CSS drop-shadows that rotate away from the cursor position to create depth and realism.

**Header Section**
Centered at the top is the primary anchor of the page.
*   **Name:** "Geva Kipper" appears in large, bold typography.
*   **Role:** Directly below, the sentence "Currently engineering solutions at Google" appears.
*   **The AI Twist:** Below the role is the subtitle explaining the AI-generated nature of the site. This text should flicker slightly like a CRT monitor. It serves as a disclaimer that the layout is ephemeral.

**The Content Grid (The Artifacts)**
The main content is arranged in a Bento-box style grid (a mosaic of rectangular cards) floating in the center of the page. The borders of these boxes are invisible in the dark. They only reveal themselves with a thin, glowing outline when the flashlight beam hits them. Each box contains a project, utilizing a "Glassmorphism" effect—semitransparent backgrounds that blur whatever is behind them.

**Card Specifics:**
Inside each box, text is minimal. When the light hits a box, the title glows, and the background subtly shifts to represent the project theme:

1.  **GlglStats:** The background features a subtle, audio-wave visualization pattern. It contains a "Play" button icon linking to the video and an external link icon for the website.
2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk:** Use a wireframe map or heat-map texture as the subtle background. Includes three distinct text links for the news stories and the Facebook post, styled as "citations."
3.  **2D Part Orienting:** The visual motif here is geometric polygons. The link leads to the project documentation.
4.  **The Turing Jest:** The card features a chat-bubble motif. The link is a prominent button styled like a prompt input field.
5.  **Rhymes of Israel:** The background mimics a classic newsprint texture but inverted (dark mode). The link is styled as a "Download Extension" badge.
6.  **Meta Portfolio:** This box acts as a "mirror." It contains the text "You are here" and a recursive link to the current domain. Visually, it should have a slightly reflective or metallic sheen compared to the others.

**Footer & Socials**
The bottom section requires the user to "sweep" the floor with their light to find the external connections.
*   **Social Cluster:** The GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook links are not text, but large, minimalistic SVG icons that light up in their respective brand colors (Purple for GitHub, Blue for LinkedIn/FB) only when the flashlight passes directly over them.

**The Timekeeper**
Anchored at the very bottom right (or center bottom on mobile) is the final element: The Stopwatch.
*   **Visual:** This looks like a piece of hardware equipment—a retro red LED digital clock sitting in the dark.
*   **Function:** It counts upwards in real-time (HH:MM:SS) starting from the date **2026-02-02 01:28:28**.
*   **Credits:** Just above the clock, in small, terminal-style text, is the credit: "Site architecture generated by AI Model [Model Name]."

**Mobile Considerations**
On touch devices where "hover/cursor" doesn't exist, the flashlight effect should be replaced by a Gyroscope effect (tilting the phone moves the light focus) or a pulse animation that automatically spotlights different sections of the grid in a loop.
