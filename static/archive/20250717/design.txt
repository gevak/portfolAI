### A. Overall Design & Vibe

The website is a single-page, vertically scrolling interface designed to look and feel like the command and control panel of a futuristic starship, the "USS Geekiprise." The primary color palette is a dark, deep space blue/black (#0A0F1E), accented with glowing cyan (#00FFFF), electric orange (#FF8C00), and clean white for text. The entire interface has a subtle, persistent animation of a sparse starfield drifting slowly in the background. A faint, hexagonal grid overlay gives the page texture. All interactive elements glow brighter and emit a soft, sci-fi "bleep" sound on hover. The typography uses a futuristic, geometric sans-serif font (like Orbitron or a similar custom font) for titles and a clean, monospaced font for descriptive text, simulating a terminal readout.

### B. Header Section: The Bridge View

The top of the page immediately establishes the theme.

*   **Main Title:** "OPERATOR: GEVA KIPPER" is displayed in large, glowing cyan letters at the top center.
*   **Official Role:** Beneath the name, in a smaller, white monospaced font, is the line: `PRIMARY DIRECTIVE: Engineering advanced systems at Google.`
*   **AI Subtitle:** To the right, in its own small, flashing console box labeled "SYSTEM STATUS," is the text: `AESTHETIC PROTOCOL: RECALIBRATED DAILY BY AI. CURRENT ITERATION: STABLE.` The word "STABLE" flickers slightly, suggesting a live status.

### C. Project Modules: Starship System Diagnostics

The main content consists of six hexagonal containers arranged in a staggered, two-column layout down the page. Each hexagon acts as a "module" or "data pod," with its border glowing faintly. As the user scrolls, each module animates into view, its border brightening and its content fading in, as if being activated.

**1. Module 01: GlglStats - Audio Pattern Analysis**

*   **Title:** `//AUDIO_ANALYSIS: GLGLSTATS`
*   **Description:** `Python project utilizing LZ77 compression to measure and visualize repetition in Israeli pop-music. Deployed to identify pattern saturation in popular songs.`
*   **Visuals:** The background of this hexagon features a slowly oscillating, glowing cyan sine wave, representing an audio signal.

**2. Module 02: Ahuzat Dibuk - Urban Logistics Matrix**

*   **Title:** `//URBAN_LOGISTICS: AHUZAT DIBUK`
*   **Description:** `Python-based data scraping and visualization of Tel-Aviv parking lot occupancy. Generates predictive heat-maps for residential use.`
*   **Visuals:** The background shows a faint, animated heatmap of a city grid, with colors subtly shifting from cool blue to warm orange.

**3. Module 03: 2D Part Orienting - Geometric Calibration**

*   **Title:** `//GEOMETRIC_CALIBRATION: 2D PART ORIENTING`
*   **Description:** `C++ implementation of an efficient algorithm for constructing a 'push plan' to orient any given polygon within an open-source computational geometry library.`
*   **Visuals:** A wireframe 2D polygon is shown in the background, slowly rotating and periodically aligning to a faint, dotted outline.

**4. Module 04: The Turing Jest - Artificial Humor Subsystem**

*   **Title:** `//HUMOR_SUBSYSTEM: THE TURING JEST`
*   **Description:** `An LLM arena for competitive pun generation and explanation. User ratings determine combatant model viability.`
*   **Visuals:** The background has a cascade of falling, glowing characters, similar to the Matrix code-fall but composed of puns and symbols like `:)` and `?;`.

**5. Module 05: Rhymes of Israel - Cultural Protocol Modulator**

*   **Title:** `//CULTURAL_MODULATOR: RHYMES OF ISRAEL`
*   **Description:** `A Chrome extension leveraging an LLM to rewrite Israeli news headlines into comedic, high-school yearbook-style rhymes.`
*   **Visuals:** An animated icon of a futuristic quill pen is shown rewriting a line of standard text into a rhyming, stylized script.

**6. Module 06: META - Ship's Interface Schematics**

*   **Title:** `//META: PROJECT GEEKIP.DEV`
*   **Description:** `This portfolio command interface is a self-referential project demonstrating modern front-end design principles with a futuristic, thematic execution.`
*   **Visuals:** The background displays a simplified, glowing schematic of the website layout itself, with animated lines connecting the different hexagonal modules.

### D. Footer Section: External Comms & Chronometer

The final section at the bottom of the page is split into two parts.

**1. External Communications Array:**

*   This is the seventh box, a horizontal rectangle labeled `//EXTERNAL_COMMS_LINK`.
*   Inside, three identical hexagonal buttons feature glowing, minimalist versions of the GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook logos. Hovering over each reveals the text `GITHUB`, `LINKEDIN`, or `FACEBOOK` below it.
*   **Links:** The buttons link to github.com/gevak, linkedin.com/in/gevakip, and facebook.com/geva.kipper respectively.

**2. Engineering & Mission Clock:**

*   At the very bottom of the page is a single line of small, white monospaced text:
    `Interface design protocol executed by AI model GPT-4.`
*   Below this, a prominent digital "Mission Clock" is displayed, with a label `SYSTEM UPTIME`. It shows a live, ticking stopwatch of the time elapsed since 2025-07-17 01:13:33, formatted as `YYYY:DDD:HH:MM:SS`.
