The page opens with a bold, central title reading **“Geva Kipper”**, with his role and current work at Google summarized directly beneath in one clean sentence, using subtle, modern typography (sleek sans-serif, with a slight gradient shimmer effect). Below it, an animated subtitle fades in: *“This portfolio is redesigned daily by AI — no two visits ever look the same.”* A faint transition effect such as pixel morphing or a shifting gradient background visually reinforces that the site is alive and ever-changing.  

The central theme is **trading cards** — each project is presented as an interactive **collectible card** floating in a neatly arranged 3x3 grid (with the last box spanning the width of the row for symmetry). Each card has the proportions and aesthetic of a rare game card: rounded edges, a delicate embossed frame, a dynamic glow on hover, and a back/front flip effect triggered on click. The front shows a stylized title, a short tagline, and a mini-icon that fits the theme of the project; flipping the card reveals details such as links, videos, and descriptions. Subtle animations bring the cards to life — text fading in, elements expanding slightly — with a sense of playful collectibility.  

1. **GlglStats Card:** Front has a waveform/musical note graphic, title in bold playful typography. Back reveals description, a direct link to the GlglStats site, and a thumbnail image leading to the PyData TLV YouTube presentation.  
   
2. **Ahuzat Dibuk Card:** Styled with a parking-pattern heatmap in neon blues and reds. On flip, reveal the project description and three compact links (news articles + Facebook post).  

3. **2D Part Orienting Card:** A clean geometric polygon illustration on the front. Back shows project description with a link to the technical library. This card leans into a blueprint aesthetic with thin-line vector art and a mechanical feel.  

4. **The Turing Jest Card:** Bright, slightly whimsical — front shows two AI mascots facing off in a playful manner. Flip reveals the description and a glowing button link to the pun competition site.  

5. **Rhymes of Israel Card:** Styled with Hebrew typography textures, bold comic-like rhymes scribbled across the frame. On flip, reveal description and the Chrome Web Store installation button.  

6. **Meta Portfolio Card:** Self-referential — front appears like a mirror or reflective holographic card. Flip displays descriptive text and a button back to **geekip.dev**.  

7. **Social Links Card:** This card spans the bottom row. It has a minimalist “collector’s legend” style: clean dark background with three icon-buttons (GitHub, LinkedIn, Facebook) arranged like treasured emblems.  

The entire grid floats gently with a parallax scroll effect — when the page is scrolled, cards shift slightly apart in z-space, as if suspended in air. Subtle background textures (like shifting holographic foil or trading-card shimmer) change dynamically, emphasizing the “ever-changing” AI theme.  

At the very bottom, tucked elegantly into the footer: a small line of text credits the site’s creation to *“Generated by an AI model.”* Next to it sits the **stopwatch**, styled as a digital counter with subtle glow, continuously updating to show exact elapsed time since *2025-08-17 01:14:05*.  

The overall palette is sleek but playful: dark background for contrast, holographic and foiled color accents, minimal but striking typography, and card-specific theming for individuality. The effect is a modern, elegant, yet creatively gamified showcase — Geva Kipper’s projects as a collectible deck, inviting curiosity and interaction.
