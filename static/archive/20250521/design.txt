# Neural Network Portfolio Design Concept

## Overall Theme
The website will be designed as an interactive neural network visualization that "generates" project descriptions. As visitors interact with the site, they'll see network nodes lighting up and connections forming, simulating the AI processing that "creates" the daily changing portfolio.

## Layout & Aesthetics
- **Color Scheme**: Deep blue background with neon blue, purple, and white accents for the neural network visualization
- **Typography**: Modern, monospace font for technical elements and a clean sans-serif for readability
- **Animation**: Subtle particle effects connecting different sections, simulating data flow

## Header
The header features "Geva Kipper" in bold, prominent typography with a sleek gradient underline. Beneath, a single sentence about Geva's current work at Google. A subtitle explains the site is re-designed daily by AI and is ever-changing, with a subtle animation showing the text "regenerating" periodically.

## Neural Network Visualization
A central interactive network visualization spans the page background. As users hover over different project sections, relevant nodes in the network illuminate and connect, simulating the AI "focusing" on generating that project's description.

## Project Sections
Each project appears as a hexagonal cell in the neural network. When activated (hovered/clicked), the cell expands to reveal:

1. **GlglStats**: Features waveform visualizations that mirror the project's audio analysis capabilities. Links to the site and video presentation appear as glowing connection points.

2. **Ahuzat Dibuk**: Shows an animated heat-map gradient in the background. News story and Facebook links appear as data points flowing from the project node.

3. **2D Part Orienting**: Features subtle geometric animations showing polygon orientation. The code link appears as a terminal-style input command.

4. **Meta Portfolio**: This section has a recursive visual effect, showing miniature versions of the other sections within itself, creating a visual paradox.

5. **Social Links**: The GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook links appear as distinct nodes in the network, with custom icons that pulse gently, encouraging interaction.

## Interactive Elements
- Cursor appears as a small "data point" that leaves a brief trail
- Scroll-triggered animations show the neural network "thinking" and generating new connections
- Project sections fade in sequentially as the user scrolls down

## Footer
Features credit to the AI model that created the site, styled as a terminal command line output. The stopwatch counting time since 2025-05-21 has a digital retro display look, with seconds visibly ticking in real-time.

## Responsive Behavior
On mobile devices, the neural network collapses to a simpler linear flow, with project cells stacked vertically while maintaining their interactive expansion capability.
