The portfolio will be a **single-page, immersive, scroll-triggered storytelling experience**, with the entire site behaving like a cinematic timeline of Geva Kipper’s coding life. As the visitor scrolls, scenes animate into view—like panels of an interactive graphic novel—each revealing a project with motion, depth, and playful visual metaphors. The background will be dark, with subtle animated gradient glows that shift as the user progresses, accompanied by smooth parallax effects and gentle floating code snippets drifting in the distance.

**HEADER & INTRO**  
- **Full-screen opening section**, black background with thin, animated vaporwave-style colored lines tracing across, mimicking code compilation.  
- Large, bold white text in a sleek monospace font:  
  `Geva Kipper`  
- Beneath: *"Currently building magical things at Google."* in a lighter gray.  
- Subtitle in italic neon blue: *"This site is re-designed every day by AI — It’s never the same twice."* This text flickers slightly like an old CRT monitor effect.  
- A down arrow subtly pulses to indicate scroll.

**SCROLL SECTIONS — 6 + LINKS**  
Each section will scroll into view via **scroll-triggered reveal animations**: the content is hidden off-screen and slides/fades in as the user reaches it. Each will have its own unique motion theme that reflects the nature of the project.

1. **GlglStats**  
   - Background morphs into abstract, pulsing *waveforms* resembling audio patterns, animated in sync with faint beats.  
   - Large project title in white; below, a short description in smaller font.  
   - Side-by-side layout: left side with a framed embedded video of the PyData TLV talk that auto-pauses when not visible; right side with the link to `https://glglstats.geekip.dev` styled as a glowing terminal-style button.  

2. **Ahuzat Dibuk**  
   - Background shifts to a **night-time Tel Aviv street view** silhouette with glowing animated heat-map spots moving faintly.  
   - The project card slides up with a scrape-animation effect (as if revealing scraped data).  
   - Buttons for the two news articles and Facebook post appear as *floating post-it notes* that hover slightly on mouse-over.  

3. **2D Part Orienting**  
   - Background changes to animated wireframe polygons spinning gently in 3D space.  
   - Project title fades in letter-by-letter, followed by a short description.  
   - "Learn More" button to `https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/` appears as a rotating hexagonal button matching the geometry theme.  

4. **The Turing Jest**  
   - Background transforms into a neon theater stage with animated speech bubbles floating upward like balloons.  
   - The section animates by “typing out” a pun that fades and is replaced by another, hinting at the humor-based AI competition.  
   - Link to `https://jest.geekip.dev` styled as an *arcade button* that enlarges slightly when hovered.  

5. **Rhymes of Israel**  
   - Background turns into an animated stack of news headlines, which distort and transform into rhyming comedic lines in a bold handwritten font.  
   - Chrome Web Store install button appears as a ribbon banner, waving gently.  

6. **Portfolio Website (Meta)**  
   - The entire frame becomes a mirror-like surface reflecting distorted versions of the user’s own cursor movements.  
   - Text explains the meta nature of the site, linking to `https://geekip.dev` as a shimmering hyperlink.  

7. **Links & Profiles**  
   - Final section appears like a black starfield, with floating glowing connection orbs labeled GitHub, LinkedIn, Facebook.  
   - On hover, each orb illuminates more brightly and reveals the URL below.

**FOOTER**  
- Black background with faint stars.  
- Text in minimalist white: *"Designed by an AI model for Geva Kipper"* in small, subtle font.  
- Below: a **digital stopwatch** in bright cyan counting how long since `2025-08-13 01:09:53` in `HH:MM:SS` format, updating in real-time. Clock has a soft glow effect, as if it’s floating in space.

---

**MOTION & INTERACTIVITY**  
- Smooth easing on all scroll animations.  
- Subtle reactive animations: background gradient slightly shifts tone as the cursor moves, giving a sense of depth.  
- Everything is **fully responsive**, adapting gracefully to mobile with vertical stacking while retaining the animation flow.

If you like, I can now also **create a fully fleshed-out HTML/CSS/JS mockup** for this exact design so your designer has working code to start from. Would you like me to do that?
