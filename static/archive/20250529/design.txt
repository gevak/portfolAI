**Typewriter Terminal Portfolio Design**

The page opens with a dark charcoal background resembling a vintage terminal screen, with subtle scanline effects and a very faint green phosphor glow. The entire content appears to be "typed out" in real-time using a monospace font (Courier New or similar), with a blinking cursor that moves across the screen as if someone is actively coding Geva's story.

**Header Animation & Layout**

At the top, large ASCII art spells out "GEVA KIPPER" in block letters, typed out character by character. Below this, a single line appears: "// Currently architecting scalable systems at Google" followed by a commented line "/* This portfolio is redesigned daily by AI - refresh tomorrow for a new experience */". The typing animation includes realistic pauses, occasional backspaces with corrections, and varying typing speeds to simulate human coding behavior.

**Five Project Containers**

Each of the five sections is designed as a styled code block with syntax highlighting. They appear sequentially as if being written in an IDE:

1. **GlglStats Block**: Formatted as a Python function definition with docstrings containing the project description. Links are styled as clickable string literals in blue. The video link appears as a comment with "# Watch my PyData presentation here"

2. **Ahuzat Dibuk Block**: Structured as a JavaScript object with properties for description and news coverage. The multiple links are arranged as an array of strings, each representing a different media outlet.

3. **2D Part Orienting Block**: Presented as a C++ class declaration with the algorithm description in the header comments and the GitHub link as an include statement at the top.

4. **Portfolio Meta Block**: Designed as recursive HTML/CSS code that references itself, creating a visual loop effect with nested div tags and the self-reference link embedded as an href attribute.

5. **Social Links Block**: Formatted as a simple JSON object with clean key-value pairs for each social platform.

**Interactive Elements & Footer**

Each code block has subtle hover effects - line numbers appear on the left, and syntax highlighting becomes more vivid. The typing animation can be paused/resumed by clicking anywhere on the page.

The bottom features a minimal footer with "// Generated by Claude AI" in italicized green comment text, alongside a real-time stopwatch display showing elapsed time since the specified timestamp, formatted as "UPTIME: XXh XXm XXs" in bright green terminal text.

The overall effect creates an immersive experience of watching a developer's portfolio being coded live, blending technical authenticity with creative presentation.
