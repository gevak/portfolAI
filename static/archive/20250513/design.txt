# GitHub Contribution Graph Portfolio Design for Geva Kipper

## Core Concept
A full-screen interactive GitHub-style contribution graph that transitions from a standard contribution heatmap to an interactive portfolio. The grid cells represent different intensities, but when hovered or interacted with, they expand to reveal portfolio sections.

## Header
- Minimalist header with "Geva Kipper" in a clean sans-serif font (like Inter or Roboto)
- Subtitle: "Software Engineer at Google, focusing on scalable backend systems"
- Small animated text banner below: "This website is redesigned daily by AI and is ever-changing - today's version was created on [current date]"

## Main Interface
- Large GitHub-style contribution grid covering most of the viewport
- Grid cells vary in color intensity from light to dark green
- Five distinct "hot zones" in the grid that are visibly more intense than surrounding cells
- Subtle pulse animation on these zones to hint at interactivity
- When hovering over a hot zone, nearby cells animate outward to create space
- On click, the cells expand smoothly to reveal a project card

## Project Cards
When a hot zone is activated, an elegant card appears with:
- Project title in large, bold typography
- Brief description with animated text that types itself out
- Links styled as terminal commands (e.g., `$ open https://glglstats.onrender.com/`)
- Relevant images or icons that fade in
- For the YouTube video, a minimalist play button that expands to an embedded player
- Project-specific color accents matching the GitHub contribution intensity theme

## Interactive Elements
- Mouse trail effect leaving a subtle green glow as cursor moves across the grid
- Sound design: soft keyboard click sounds when interacting with cells (toggleable)
- When scrolling, the grid maintains position but slightly parallaxes
- On mobile, tapping hot zones triggers expansion, with a smooth animation for touch feedback

## Navigation
- Small, fixed dot navigation on the right side indicating the five sections
- Each dot corresponds to a project hot zone and glows when that section is active
- "Close" gesture (ESC key or clicking outside) collapses expanded cards back into the grid

## Project-Specific Details
1. **GlglStats Card**: Visualization of sound waves that morph into compression patterns
2. **Ahuzat Dibuk Card**: Mini heat map that transitions and zooms into actual project heatmaps
3. **2D Part Orienting Card**: Animated polygon being oriented through push operations
4. **Portfolio Website Card**: Meta representation of the site itself (recursive design)
5. **Social Links Card**: GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook links with appropriate brand icons that react to hover

## Footer
- Minimalistic footer with "Designed by [AI model name]"
- Live stopwatch counter showing time elapsed since 2025-05-13 01:06:12 in HH:MM:SS format
- The stopwatch numbers flip like an old airport departure board

## Technical Aesthetics
- Dark mode by default with subtle option to toggle light mode
- Custom cursor that changes depending on interaction context
- Smooth transitions between all states using CSS animations
- Responsive design that reorients the grid on smaller screens
- Loading state mimics GitHub's contribution graph loading animation

The overall effect should feel like discovering Geva's career within an interactive data visualization, merging the technical with the creative in a way that showcases software engineering expertise.
