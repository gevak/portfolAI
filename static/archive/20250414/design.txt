# Hackable Portfolio Design Concept for Geva Kipper

## Overall Theme
A terminal/code editor inspired interface where visitors can modify the CSS/HTML in real-time. The site begins with a clean, dark theme (dark gray background with vibrant accent colors) that resembles a modern code editor.

## Header
- Large terminal-style prompt showing "~/geva_kipper $" followed by the blinking cursor
- Name "Geva Kipper" appears as if being typed out (animation)
- Subtitle appears beneath: "Currently building innovative solutions at Google"
- Second subtitle in a slightly muted color: "This site is redesigned daily by AI and is ever-changing"

## Interactive Code Editor
- A prominent code panel at the top right showing the actual CSS/HTML of the page
- Live editing capabilities with a clear instruction: "Hack this portfolio by modifying the code"
- Changes apply in real-time as visitors type
- "Reset" button to restore original styling
- Code syntax highlighting in vibrant colors (purple, blue, green)

## Project Display
Five hexagonal containers arranged in a honeycomb pattern, each representing a project:
1. **GlglStats** - Background subtly showing sound wave patterns, Python logo, and compression visualization samples
2. **Ahuzat Dibuk** - Background showing a faded heatmap of parking data with car silhouettes
3. **2D Part Orienting** - Animated geometric shapes being oriented/rotated in the background
4. **Portfolio Website** - Recursive visual showing a miniature version of the site itself
5. **Social Links** - Three interconnected nodes representing GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook with their logos

## Interactive Elements
- Hovering over projects causes them to "glitch" slightly and reveal additional details
- Clicking expands the hexagon to show full project information and links
- Terminal commands can be typed at the top to navigate (e.g., "cd GlglStats" to focus on that project)
- Easter eggs activated by specific CSS modifications

## Footer
- Credits line: "Design generated by [Your AI Model Name]"
- Terminal-style stopwatch counting time since 2025-04-14 01:05:46 in format "Running: 00h 00m 00s"
- Small ASCII art signature

## Special Features
- Visitor modifications are temporarily saved in local storage
- A gallery of "previous visitors' edits" can be viewed
- Color theme variables are clearly labeled in the CSS for easy modification
- Responsive design that maintains the hackable aspect across devices
- Console messages that give hints about hidden features
