# Vending Machine Portfolio Design

The entire page is styled as a large, isometric 3D vending machine viewed at a slight angle, with a glossy red and chrome finish reminiscent of classic Coca-Cola machines but with a tech-forward aesthetic. The machine occupies the central viewport, with a subtle concrete wall texture as the background and dramatic spotlighting from above creating realistic shadows.

At the top of the machine, a glowing neon sign displays "GEVA KIPPER" in retro-futuristic lettering with a subtle flicker animation. Directly below, a smaller LED-style digital display shows the subtitle about the site being redesigned daily by AI, with text that scrolls horizontally like an old-school ticker tape. Just beneath that, a single line in smaller LED text describes his current work at Google, perhaps reading "Currently brewing algorithms at Google" with a coffee cup icon.

The main body of the vending machine features a glass front panel divided into 7 illuminated slots arranged in a 2-3-2 grid pattern. Each slot contains a miniature 3D diorama representing a project, with physical objects suspended behind the glass - like actual vending machine products. Project 1 (GlglStats) shows tiny musical notes and compression symbols floating around a small Python logo. Project 2 (Ahuzat Dibuk) displays miniature cars and parking space grid. Project 3 (2D Part Orienting) features geometric shapes and polygons. Project 4 (The Turing Jest) shows comedy masks and speech bubbles. Project 5 (Rhymes of Israel) displays a tiny Chrome logo with Hebrew letters. Project 6 (Portfolio site) shows a recursive, smaller vending machine. Project 7 (Social links) contains recognizable social media icons as physical objects.

To the right of the glass panel, a vertical column of large, chunky mechanical buttons (A1, A2, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2) with individual backlighting corresponds to each project slot. When a button is pressed, it physically depresses with a satisfying click sound, the corresponding slot lights up brighter, and a detailed project card "dispenses" from the bottom dispenser flap of the machine with a smooth mechanical animation - sliding down and forward as if a real product is being delivered.

The dispensed card appears as a physical card that pops out and expands into a larger floating panel in front of the machine, tilted slightly for depth. Each card has a retro product label aesthetic with the project name in bold vintage typography, a brief description, and prominent "VIEW PROJECT," "WATCH VIDEO," or "READ MORE" buttons styled as bottle cap badges. Links are embedded as scannable QR codes in the corner of each card, maintaining the physical product theme. A small "RETURN" button styled as a coin return lever collapses the card back into the machine.

The dispenser flap at the bottom of the machine remains visible throughout, with a subtle glow when inactive. Above the flap, a small rectangular screen shows a pixelated readout that changes based on which project is selected, displaying retro-style stats or fun facts about each project.

At the very bottom of the page, below the vending machine on the concrete floor, there's a small metal plaque that reads "Designed by [AI Model Name] • Digital Craftsmanship Since 2025" with elegant engraving effects. Next to it, a vintage flip-clock or digital counter displays the time elapsed since November 7th, 2025, 01:07:45, with individual panels flipping for hours, minutes, and seconds, styled like an old vending machine coin counter.

Subtle environmental details enhance the scene: a faint hum ambient sound loop, occasional fluorescent light flicker on the neon sign, condensation droplets on the glass that slowly drip down, and a very subtle CRT scanline effect on the LED displays. The cursor changes to a finger pointer when hovering over buttons, and to a coin icon when hovering over project slots, reinforcing the vending machine interaction metaphor.
