The website unfolds as a single, vertically scrolling Git commit history, stretching across the page like an infinite terminal. Each project appears as a "commit" node on a central vertical timeline line, slightly offset left and right in alternating sequence. The look is that of a stylized modern Git log: crisp black background, slightly transparent neon-colored commit bubbles (changing hue subtly on hover), and thin connecting lines with a faint animated “push” pulse effect traveling upward, hinting at ongoing activity. The commits animate onto the page as if being typed in real-time—the commit hash, date, and commit message fading in with a typing cursor flicker before revealing the “file changes” (the project content).

At the top of the page, in bold monospace typography, the header reads:  
`commit HEAD → main` followed by **"Geva Kipper"** in a large, friendly but still tech-flavored font. Beneath it, a one-line description: *"Currently building AI-driven solutions at Google to make information universally accessible and useful."*  
A subheader in softer color reads: *"This site is re-designed daily by an AI, so it's never quite the same twice."*  
This fades in as though being output by an old terminal, letter by letter, with a blinking caret.

Each commit “node” contains a commit message like a real Git log entry, e.g.:  
**`commit e4c2b5│Author: Geva Kipper <gevak@geekip.dev>`**  
**`Date:   <timestamp>`**  
Then below, the message itself in punchy commit style, e.g. *`Add GlglStats - Python song repetition analysis tool`*. On click or hover, the node “expands” via a smooth CSS scale transform to reveal the project block: 
- A thumbnail, animated GIF, or embedded media.
- A short paragraph in clean sans-serif text.
- Relevant clickable links styled as diff lines:  
  Example: `+ https://glglstats.geekip.dev` appears in green monospace like a Git diff addition, animating in from the left.

The six main projects each form their own commit entry, with the special case of “this portfolio website” being self-referential (“meta commit”), perhaps with an amusing commit message like *`Refactor portfolio into an infinitely versioned timeline`*. The social links appear as the *last commit*, with the message *`Add contact links and profile endpoints`*, and placeholders for the three network icons in shimmering white SVGs, turning into their brand colors when hovered.

The final row beneath the last commit is a “git log footer” in slightly dim console green:
```

Time since build: 0000:00:00
```
The stopwatch count animates live from the given start date and time, updating in real time. Its styling matches the git log aesthetic, with each colon slightly pulsing to mimic a ticker.

Between commits, as the user scrolls down, faint animated “merge lines” weave in and out, sometimes branching before rejoining—purely decorative but giving the feeling that these projects form part of a larger evolving codebase. Small commit hashes float faintly in the background like constellations, subtly parallaxing for depth.

At the very bottom, after the final commit, a blinking terminal prompt appears waiting for the “next command,” giving an open-ended sense that Geva’s portfolio is never complete—just like an ever-growing Git repo.
