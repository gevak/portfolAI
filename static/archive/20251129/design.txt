# Black Friday Portfolio: "STACK OVERFLOW DEALS" Design Concept

## Overall Theme & Atmosphere

The website mimics a chaotic, high-energy Black Friday electronics store landing page—think aggressive countdown timers, "DOORBUSTER" banners, price slash graphics, and that unmistakable retail urgency—but selling coding skills instead of TVs. The color palette is classic Black Friday: deep matte black background, electric neon yellow (#FFE500) for highlights, hot red (#FF3131) for "sale" accents, and crisp white text. Subtle scanline effects overlay the entire page, giving it a slightly retro CRT monitor aesthetic that nods to both old-school retail displays and vintage computing.

## Header Section

A massive "door-buster" style banner stretches across the top with diagonal yellow caution stripes on the edges. The name **"GEVA KIPPER"** appears in an ultra-bold, slightly condensed sans-serif font (think Impact meets modern geometric typefaces), with a fake "crossed-out" price above it reading "~~$999,999~~" and below it "NOW: OPEN TO OFFERS." A small Google logo sits beside a single line in a typewriter font: *"Currently engineering chaos at Google."*

Directly beneath, a red ticker tape scrolls horizontally (like a stock market ticker or news crawl) containing the subtitle: *"⚡ THIS SITE REDESIGNS ITSELF DAILY VIA AI • WHAT YOU SEE TODAY WILL NEVER EXIST AGAIN • LIMITED TIME REALITY ⚡"* — it loops infinitely, creating urgency.

## Navigation & Layout

No traditional nav bar. Instead, the six project boxes are arranged in a staggered "deal cards" layout—imagine uneven retail shelf displays. On desktop, they form a loose 3x2 grid but with intentional misalignment: some cards tilted 1-2 degrees, some slightly overlapping, creating visual energy. Each card has a "price tag" hanging off its corner on a small animated string/rope graphic.

## Project Cards Design

Each card is styled as a product listing with:
- A "CATEGORY" label in the top corner (shaped like a retail sticker): e.g., "DATA SCIENCE," "CHROME EXTENSION," "OPEN SOURCE"
- A fake barcode graphic along one edge
- A "WAS/NOW" price comparison showing absurd numbers crossed out
- A pulsing "ADD TO WISHLIST" heart icon that does nothing but looks clickable
- A small "★★★★★ (1 REVIEW)" beneath each, where clicking reveals a humorous fake testimonial

**Card 1 — GlglStats:**
Header reads "DOORBUSTER DEAL 🔊" in a starburst shape. The card background shows a faint waveform pattern. Main text describes the LZ77 compression analysis of Israeli pop songs. Two prominent buttons styled as retail "BUY NOW" buttons: one yellow linking to the site, one red (styled as "WATCH DEMO") embedding or linking to the PyData TLV YouTube video. A small "AS SEEN ON: PyData TLV" badge in the corner.

**Card 2 — Ahuzat Dibuk:**
Styled as a "CLEARANCE ITEM" with an angled red "70% OFF" banner across the corner. Background shows a subtle parking lot grid pattern. Description covers the Tel-Aviv parking data scraping project. "FEATURED IN" section displays tiny logos/text for Channel 13 and Mako, each clickable. A "VIRAL ON" Facebook badge links to the Secret Tel Aviv post. A miniature heat-map graphic decorates one corner.

**Card 3 — 2D Part Orienting:**
Tagged as "FOR THE SERIOUS BUYER ONLY 🎓" with a more subdued, technical appearance—graph paper texture background, geometric polygon shapes floating subtly. Describes the C++ computational geometry work. Single prominent link button to the TAU project page, styled as a blueprint/schematic button.

**Card 4 — The Turing Jest:**
This card is the most playful—tagged "LAUGH NOW, CODE LATER 😂" with a comedy club neon sign aesthetic within the card. Background has subtle stage curtain texture. Describes the LLM pun arena. A fake "AUDIENCE FAVORITE" ribbon across the corner. Link button styled as a microphone icon leading to the site.

**Card 5 — Rhymes of Israel:**
Styled as a "NEW ARRIVAL ✨" with sparkle animations. Background shows faint Hebrew newspaper column texture. Describes the Chrome extension. A Chrome Web Store badge-style button for installation. A small preview showing a fake headline transformed into a rhyme, displayed on a mock browser window graphic.

**Card 6 — This Portfolio (Meta):**
This card has a special "INCEPTION SPECIAL" tag with an infinity symbol. The card appears to have a slight recursive visual—a tiny version of the whole website visible within it, like a mirror effect. Describes the self-referential nature. Link styled as "VIEW CURRENT DEAL" pointing to geekip.dev. A "♻️ SELF-REFERENTIAL DISCOUNT" badge.

## Social Links Section (Card 7)

Styled as the "CHECKOUT COUNTER" — a horizontal bar designed to look like a retail checkout conveyor belt with subtle animation. Three large buttons styled as cash register keys: GitHub (green), LinkedIn (blue), Facebook (darker blue). Each has a small "SCAN HERE" barcode beneath the icon. A small "FOLLOW FOR FUTURE DEALS" tagline.

## Footer

Designed as a receipt paper strip with torn perforation edges at the top. Contains:
- "TRANSACTION GENERATED BY: [AI Model Name]" in receipt-style monospace font
- "STORE OPENED:" followed by the live stopwatch counting up from 2025-11-29 01:04:46, displayed in large LED-style red digits (like an old digital clock), showing HOURS : MINUTES : SECONDS
- A "THANK YOU FOR SHOPPING" message
- A fake barcode with "GEEKIP-2025" encoded visually

## Micro-interactions & Animations

- Cards slightly "bounce" or scale up on hover, mimicking the excitement of grabbing a deal
- The yellow highlights occasionally "flicker" like neon signs
- Price tags on cards sway gently as if hanging
- A subtle "shopping cart" icon in the corner shows "6 SKILLS IN CART" but is non-functional
- Confetti or sparkle particles occasionally burst from "DOORBUSTER" labels
- The scrolling ticker tape speeds up momentarily when hovered
- Background has very subtle falling price tags or percentage symbols, like snow

## Typography

Headlines: Ultra-bold condensed sans-serif (Bebas Neue or similar)
Body: Clean modern sans-serif (Inter or Roboto)
Accents: Monospace for "prices" and technical details (JetBrains Mono)
Occasional handwritten-style font for "LIMITED TIME!" callouts

## Responsive Behavior

On mobile, cards stack vertically as a single column, maintaining the chaotic sticker/tag overlaps. The ticker scrolls faster. The receipt footer becomes even more prominent, and the stopwatch digits grow larger as the dramatic "bottom line" of the page.
