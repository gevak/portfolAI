### **Portfolio Design: "The AI Analyst's Briefing"**

**Overall Concept:**

The entire webpage is a single, continuous stream of output from an AI, as if it's presenting an analytical briefing on the subject, Geva Kipper. The user is not interacting *with* a chatbot; they are reading the chatbot's monologue. The aesthetic is a clean, modern, dark-themed "data-terminal" interface, with a focus on typography, subtle animations, and a structured, analytical flow.

**Visual Execution:**

*   **Background:** A very dark navy blue or off-black, with a faint, almost imperceptible animated grid or static noise effect to give it texture and a sense of being a live screen.
*   **Typography:** A crisp, monospaced font for all headings, titles, and UI elements (e.g., `Fira Code`, `Source Code Pro`). A highly readable, clean sans-serif font for body text (e.g., `Inter`, `Roboto`).
*   **Color Palette:** The primary text color is a soft, light grey. The main accent color is a vibrant-but-not-neon cyan, used for links, highlights, and icons. A secondary accent, a warm magenta, is used exclusively for hover effects on interactive elements.

**Page Flow & Section Descriptions:**

**1. The Header / Initial Viewport:**

Upon loading, the page displays a single blinking cyan cursor. After a one-second pause, the following text types out character by character:

`Initializing subject analysisâ€¦`
`Subject Identified: Geva Kipper`

This text then fades up and is replaced by the main header, which appears instantly:

**Geva Kipper**
`[Current Designation: Software Engineer at Google, focusing on large-scale data systems and applied AI.]`

Directly below, in a smaller font size and slightly lower opacity, is the subtitle, prefixed with a "System Status" tag:

`[System Status: This interface is procedurally generated daily. Visuals and syntax may vary.]`

**2. The Project Briefing Sections:**

As the user scrolls down, the project sections appear one by one, fading in and sliding into place. The layout alternates, creating a zig-zag pattern down the page to guide the eye. Each project is presented as a "data card" with a thin, cyan top border.

*   **Project 1: GlglStats (Aligned Left)**
    *   **Title:** `[Project Analysis: GlglStats]`
    *   **Body:** A description of the Python project measuring song repetitiveness.
    *   **Links:** Presented as command-line style prompts:
        *   `> Access Live Site: https://glglstats.geekip.dev`
        *   `> Review Conference Recording [PyData TLV]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo`

*   **Project 2: Ahuzat Dibuk (Aligned Right)**
    *   **Title:** `[Project Analysis: Ahuzat Dibuk]`
    *   **Body:** A description of the Python scraping and data visualization project for parking occupancy.
    *   **Links:**
        *   `> View Media Coverage [Channel 13]: [Link]`
        *   `> View Media Coverage [Mako]: [Link]`
        *   `> Access Original Publication [Facebook]: [Link]`

*   **Project 3: 2D Part Orienting (Aligned Left)**
    *   **Title:** `[Project Analysis: 2D Part Orienting]`
    *   **Body:** A description of the C++ computational geometry algorithm implementation. On hover, the word "polygon" in the text briefly highlights with a simple geometric shape overlay.
    *   **Links:**
        *   `> Review Algorithm & Code: [Link]`

*   **Project 4: The Turing Jest (Aligned Right)**
    *   **Title:** `[Project Analysis: The Turing Jest]`
    *   **Body:** A description of the LLM arena for generating and rating puns. The title itself has a subtle "glitch" animation effect that plays once on reveal.
    *   **Links:**
        *   `> Access Experimental Arena: https://jest.geekip.dev`

*   **Project 5: Rhymes of Israel (Aligned Left)**
    *   **Title:** `[Project Analysis: Rhymes of Israel]`
    *   **Body:** A description of the Chrome extension that rewrites news headlines into rhymes.
    *   **Links:**
        *   `> Install Chrome Extension: [Link]`

*   **Project 6: This Portfolio (Aligned Right)**
    *   **Title:** `[Project Analysis: Meta-Analysis_Portfolio_v.Current]`
    *   **Body:** A description of the portfolio website itself, framed as the AI's self-awareness of its own container. "This interface is a self-referential project demonstrating modern front-end capabilities."
    *   **Links:**
        *   `> Access Root Domain: https://geekip.dev`

**3. External Links Section:**

Below the projects, a centered section appears with a final title:

`[External Data Protocols]`

Three distinct, clean buttons are arranged horizontally. Each button contains an icon (GitHub Octocat, LinkedIn 'in', Facebook 'f') and the site's name. On hover, the button's border glows magenta, and the icon and text change to magenta.

*   `[GitHub]`
*   `[LinkedIn]`
*   `[Facebook]`

**4. Footer / Signature:**

At the very bottom of the page, aligned to the right, is the AI's signature and a live timer. The text is small and in the light grey color.

`Design procedurally generated by language model GPT-4.`
`System Uptime: [A live-updating stopwatch showing HHH:MM:SS from 2025-09-18 01:02:26]`
