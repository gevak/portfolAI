# Glitch-to-Clean Portfolio Design Concept for Geva Kipper

## Core Concept
A glitch art aesthetic portfolio that begins with digital distortion and gradually transforms into a clean, professional layout. The site initially appears to be "broken" with digital artifacts, noise, and pixelation, but smoothly transitions to a polished portfolio.

## Initial Load Experience
When visitors first arrive, the screen appears to glitch and break apart with colorful digital artifacts, scan lines, and pixel displacement. Geva's name appears through the static, as if trying to establish a connection. After 3-4 seconds, the glitches begin to organize and clean themselves up, revealing the proper website structure.

## Header
- **Developer's Name**: "GEVA KIPPER" displayed in a large, bold typeface that initially appears glitched before settling into a clean sans-serif font
- **Current Work**: A single sentence about his work at Google appears letter by letter, as if being typed
- **Subtitle**: "This portfolio is redesigned daily by AI and is ever-changing" - this text has subtle ongoing glitch effects throughout the visit

## Navigation
A minimalistic navigation bar with dot indicators for each section. As users scroll, the dots highlight the current section and occasionally "glitch" with color shifts.

## Layout
After the initial glitch transformation, the site reveals a clean grid layout with five distinct project boxes. Each box initially has slight distortion effects that clean up when hovered over.

## Project Boxes
Each project box features:
- An abstract geometric pattern in the background unique to each project
- Project title that occasionally glitches when hovered
- A clean description area
- Interactive elements that trigger minor glitch effects when interacted with
- Links styled as terminal/command-line text

## Color Scheme
- Base: Dark background (deep navy or black)
- Accent colors: Neon cyan, magenta, and electric blue that appear during glitch effects
- Text: Primarily white or light gray that settles from colored glitch states
- Highlight elements maintain slight color shifting effects

## Interactive Elements
- Mouse cursor leaves a subtle trail of digital artifacts that quickly fade
- Scrolling occasionally triggers minor glitch effects in nearby elements
- Project boxes expand slightly when hovered, becoming completely "clean" of any remaining glitch effects

## Typography
- Main headings: Monospace or tech-inspired font that initially appears corrupted
- Body text: Clean sans-serif that appears from scrambled letters
- Code snippets or links: Terminal/console styled text

## Footer
- Social media links represented by icons that occasionally glitch
- AI credit line with your name as the creator
- A digital stopwatch showing elapsed time since 2025-04-11 01:02:32, styled like an LED display with occasional glitch effects

## Responsive Behavior
On mobile, the glitch effects are subtler to maintain readability, and the projects stack vertically while maintaining their interactive qualities.

## Animations
Smooth scroll effects between sections, with occasional deliberate "frame skips" to maintain the digital aesthetic without compromising usability.
