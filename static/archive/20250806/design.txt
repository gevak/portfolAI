### Portfolio Design: The Chrono-Scroll

The website is a single, continuous vertical scroll, acting as a time machine. As the user scrolls down, the entire design aesthetic—typography, color palette, layout, and cursor—morphs to reflect different eras of digital design, from the early 90s to a speculative future. Each project is housed within its own unique design era, creating a narrative of technological and stylistic evolution. The transitions between eras are not abrupt cuts but animated "temporal rifts," where the screen briefly fills with digital static, scan lines, or a glitchy particle effect before resolving into the next design period.

**The Landing: The AI-Generated Present (2025)**

The page opens on a full-screen, dark, minimalist interface. The background is a subtle, slowly animating nebula of dark blues and purples.

*   **Header:** At the center, the name "Geva Kipper" is displayed in a clean, modern, sans-serif font with a soft white glow.
*   **Subtitle 1:** Below the name, a single sentence appears with a gentle fade-in animation: "A software engineer at Google, building the future of search."
*   **Subtitle 2:** Further down, in a slightly smaller, monospaced font, is the hook: "This site's design is regenerated daily by AI. What you see will be different tomorrow." An animated cursor blinks at the end of the sentence, as if the AI just finished typing it.
*   **Scroll Cue:** A pulsing, thin vertical line animates at the bottom of the screen, encouraging the user to begin their journey.

**Section 1: The Neumorphic Interface (Project: The Turing Jest)**

As you scroll, the dark nebula dissolves into a soft, light-gray background. The design is clean, tactile, and shadow-rich, inspired by Neumorphism. Elements appear to be extruded from or pressed into the background.

*   **Content Box:** A single, large card with soft, rounded corners dominates the section. It has a subtle inner and outer shadow, making it look like a piece of soft plastic.
*   **Title:** "The Turing Jest" is written in a friendly, rounded sans-serif font.
*   **Description:** The project description sits below the title. Icons are used to represent LLMs (a stylized brain) and users (a simple person icon).
*   **Interaction:** The button to the site, labeled "[ Enter the Arena ]", is designed as a concave, "pressable" circle. On hover, the shadows shift to make it look like the button is being pushed down.

**Section 2: The Skeuomorphic Desk (Project: Rhymes of Israel)**

The scroll transition mimics turning a page, and the view resolves into a richly textured, photorealistic wooden desk background. The design is pure skeuomorphism, reminiscent of early Apple interfaces.

*   **Content Box:** The project is presented as a high-school yearbook page lying open on the desk. The page has a thick, creamy paper texture with slightly worn edges. A Chrome logo, rendered to look like a glossy pin, is "stuck" in the corner.
*   **Title:** "Rhymes of Israel" is written in a cursive, yearbook-style font.
*   **Description:** The text is laid out like a humorous student profile.
*   **Interaction:** The call to action is a hyperlink styled to look like it was written in blue ballpoint pen. Hovering over it makes the ink appear slightly smudged.

**Section 3: Web 2.0 Gloss (Project: GlglStats)**

A "lens flare" transition brings the user into the glossy, gradient-filled world of Web 2.0. The background is a vibrant, abstract gradient of blue and green.

*   **Content Box:** A container with highly rounded corners and a thick, glossy border (the classic "aqua" button style) holds the content. The header of the box has a horizontal pinstripe pattern.
*   **Title:** "GlglStats" is written in bold Helvetica or Lucida Grande, featuring a subtle white-to-gray gradient and a 1px drop shadow. A beta badge is placed in the corner.
*   **Description:** Project details are presented with bullet points using oversized, glossy checkmark icons.
*   **Interaction:** The links to the site and the YouTube video are large, pill-shaped buttons with a heavy gloss effect. Hovering makes them "light up" from the top.
*   **Links:** https://glglstats.geekip.dev and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo

**Section 4: The GeoCities Era (Project: Ahuzat Dibuk)**

The screen "glitches" into a tiled background of a pixelated, low-resolution city map. The design is chaotic, functional, and charmingly dated, like a late-90s GeoCities or Angelfire page. Layout is managed by visible tables with 1px borders.

*   **Content Box:** Content is inside a `<TABLE>` with a jarring background color. A scrolling marquee flashes the project title, "Ahuzat Dibuk," in a serif font. An animated "Under Construction" GIF of a digging man sits next to it.
*   **Description:** The description uses a default system font like Times New Roman. Link text is default blue and underlined.
*   **Interaction:** The news and Facebook links are accompanied by low-res, pixelated logos of the respective sites. An animated GIF of a spinning car is placed near the links.
*   **Links:** https://13tv.co.il/item/news/domestic/internal/parking-902956407/, https://www.mako.co.il/nexter-news/Article-ae43964b891bf71027.htm, https://www.facebook.com/groups/secrettelaviv/posts/10159636301195943/

**Section 5: The CRT Terminal (Project: 2D Part Orienting)**

The scroll transition mimics an old CRT monitor powering on, with the screen shrinking to a point and then expanding. The entire section is contained within a curved, CRT-like frame with visible scan lines and a faint green phosphor glow. The background is black.

*   **Content Box:** There is no box. Text is rendered directly onto the "screen" in a green or amber monochrome, bitmapped font (like Fixedsys). A block cursor blinks at the end of the project description.
*   **Title:** `> 2D_PART_ORIENTING.CPP`
*   **Description:** The C++ implementation and geometry concepts are described as if they are comments in a code file.
*   **Interaction:** The link to the project page is styled as a command-line input, `[./view_project]`, which brightens on hover.
*   **Link:** https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/

**Section 6: The Abstract Future (Project: The Portfolio Itself)**

The CRT screen shatters into digital particles, which then reform into a clean, futuristic, and abstract design. The background is a stark white canvas.

*   **Content Box:** The content is not in a box but is represented by dynamically moving and connecting lines and nodes, forming a neural network-like structure. The project title and description are nodes in this network.
*   **Title:** "Meta-Portfolio" is displayed in an ultra-thin, geometric font.
*   **Description:** A short sentence explains the portfolio's time-travel concept.
*   **Interaction:** The link to itself is a central, pulsating node in the network structure. Clicking it causes the network to ripple and the page to smoothly scroll back to the very top.
*   **Link:** https://geekip.dev

**Final Section: The Timeless Void**

The abstract network fades out, leaving a simple, clean, dark gray background. The design is utilitarian and timeless.

*   **Social Links:** The GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook logos are presented as simple, white, minimalist icons. They are arranged horizontally with generous spacing. On hover, they gain a subtle glow and the name of the service appears below them in a small, clean font.
*   **Links:** github.com/gevak, linkedin.com/in/gevakip, facebook.com/geva.kipper
*   **AI Credit:** At the very bottom of the page, centered, is the text: `Site concept and design by a GPT-4 model.`
*   **Stopwatch:** Below the credit is a live stopwatch with the label: `Time Since Genesis Block:`. It actively counts up in `[HOURS]:[MINUTES]:[SECONDS]` from the timestamp `2025-08-06 01:15:02 UTC`. The font is a clear, digital-style monospace.
