### **Portfolio Design: The "Debugger" Interface**

**Overall Concept:** The website loads in a deliberately "broken" or "uncompiled" state. It appears as a chaotic jumble of overlapping elements, glitched text, and code comments. A single, prominent call-to-action prompts the user to "debug" or "run" the site. Upon clicking, a slick animation sequence unfolds, visually "compiling" the code and snapping all elements into a clean, elegant, and interactive single-page layout. The aesthetic is a blend of a dark-mode Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with a polished, minimalist design.

### **Initial State: The "Uncompiled" View**

Upon arrival, the user is greeted with what looks like a developer's work-in-progress.

*   **Background:** A dark charcoal grey (`#1a1a1a`), reminiscent of a code editor, with a very faint, animated grid or circuit pattern that subtly pulses.
*   **Elements:** The six project boxes and the final contact box are scattered across the screen. They are rotated at various angles, overlapping each other, and have low opacity. Instead of their final titles, they show placeholder text in a monospaced font, such as `// TODO: Render Project Name`, `[Object object]`, or `Status: Unresolved`.
*   **Header Text:** The name "Geva Kipper" is visible at the top but appears "glitched," with a couple of characters occasionally flickering or changing to random symbols before reverting. Below it, the sentence about his work at Google and the AI subtitle are present but garbled, as if suffering from an encoding error (e.g., `Geva Kipper wørkś at Gőøgle...`).
*   **The Call to Action:** In the center of the screen, there is a single, glowing button styled to look like it's from an IDE. The button text reads `// RUN DEBUGGER` followed by a blinking cursor `_`. This is the only clearly interactive element on the page.

### **The Interaction: The "Debugging" Animation**

When the user clicks the `// RUN DEBUGGER` button:

1.  A short, satisfying 'compile' sound effect plays.
2.  The button animates, perhaps shrinking into a central point.
3.  From this central point, glowing, colored lines (like circuit traces or dependency graphs) shoot out towards each of the scrambled boxes on the screen.
4.  As a line "connects" with a box, the box animates. It rotates to 0 degrees, scales to its final size, and moves smoothly into its correct position in the final layout. Its opacity animates to 100%.
5.  Simultaneously, the placeholder text (`[Object object]`) within the box is "resolved." The user sees the placeholder text being deleted and the final project title being typed out with a classic typewriter effect.
6.  The glitched header text at the top of the page rapidly fixes itself, character by character, revealing the correct, clean text.
7.  The entire animation sequence is fast-paced but smooth, lasting about 2-3 seconds, transforming the initial chaos into perfect order.

### **Final State: The "Compiled" Website**

The page is now a clean, organized, single-page portfolio. The IDE theme is maintained through colors and fonts, but the layout is minimalist and professional.

*   **Layout:** A responsive flexbox or grid layout. On a wide screen, it might be a 3x2 grid for the main projects, with the portfolio and contact boxes sitting below.
*   **Header:**
    *   **Name:** `Geva Kipper`. Large, in a clean, monospaced font like Fira Code or JetBrains Mono.
    *   **Job:** "Geva Kipper works at Google, focusing on large-scale systems and machine learning applications." in a smaller, sans-serif font.
    *   **Subtitle:** "This website's design is regenerated daily by AI, ensuring an ever-changing experience." This text has a very subtle, continuous flicker on one or two characters to maintain the "live AI" theme.
*   **Project Boxes:** Each box is a dark grey card with a thin, glowing border in a single accent color (e.g., electric blue or neon green).
    *   **On Hover:** The border's glow intensifies, and the card subtly lifts towards the user with a soft box-shadow.
    *   **Content:**
        *   **Title (e.g., `GlglStats`):** Displayed prominently at the top in the monospaced font.
        *   **Description:** A concise explanation in a clean sans-serif font.
        *   **Links:** Styled to look like code snippets or function calls. Instead of a plain hyperlink, links appear as:
            *   `-> view_site("https://glglstats.geekip.dev")`
            *   `-> watch_presentation("https://...")`
            *   `-> read_news_story("https://...")`
            *   `-> see_code("https://...")`
            *   `-> install_extension("https://...")`
            *   `-> self_reference("https://geekip.dev")`
        On hover, the string inside the parentheses is highlighted.
*   **Contact Box:** The final box contains three icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook. The icons are minimalist and monochromatic, taking on the accent color on hover. The title of this box could be `// connect.js`.
*   **Footer:** At the very bottom of the page, centered and in a small font size:
    *   A line of text: `UI/UX design generated by a GPT-4 class language model.`
    *   Below that, a running stopwatch with the label: `Time since last AI redesign:` followed by a live counter showing days, hours, minutes, and seconds that have passed since `2025-08-07 01:16:05`. The counter uses a digital-style font.
