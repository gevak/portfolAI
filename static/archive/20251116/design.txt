The page is a single, full-height scrolling canvas themed as a “digital tarot table.” The background is a dark, deep-space gradient (e.g., indigo to near-black) with faint, animated constellations made of tiny brackets, semicolons, and Python/C++ syntax drifting slowly. Subtle noise and a soft vignette give a tactile, paper‑meets‑screen feel. Floating near the top center: “GEVA KIPPER” in a clean serif or modern display font, slightly letter‑spaced, with a thin, glowing underline. Beneath it, a single sentence in smaller sans‑serif: “Geva Kipper is a software engineer at Google, building large-scale systems for data-intensive products.” Under that, a subtitle, slightly more playful: “This portfolio is recast each day by AI—no human sees the exact same layout twice.” This subtitle is visually connected to a small “seed of the day” line showing a random pseudo‑hash (e.g., `AI seed: 0x7f3c9a`), signaling that everything on the page is “generated” anew.

Below the heading is the main “tarot altar”: a horizontally centered area holding a loose “spread” of seven large tarot‑like cards. On desktop, the cards appear as a fanned, overlapping deck that gently floats and pulses; on mobile, they stack in a vertical carousel. On first load, an animation “shuffles” the cards (they slide and rotate slightly) and then three are dealt into the foreground in a three‑card spread (“Past / Present / Future” labels at the top of each selected card), while the remaining four hover slightly behind or at the sides. Which project appears where is randomized on each visit, but each card always has a unique visual motif and content. Each card has a front and a back: the front shows a cryptic, graphical code‑tarot illustration and a short, enigmatic title; clicking or tapping flips it with a smooth 3D rotation to reveal the project details and links. A small “Draw Again” button near the spread reshuffles the positions and reassigns the Past/Present/Future labels without leaving the page.

Each project lives in its own uniquely styled card. The “GlglStats” card uses a motif of spiraling waveforms and repeated glyphs. The border is decorated with tiny, repeating `LZ77` tokens and musical notes. The card title at the top: “GlglStats · The Looping Oracle.” Beneath, a one-sentence description: “Python project measuring the repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs via LZ77 compression, revealing their hidden repetition patterns.” The body of the card shows: a short paragraph summarizing that it visualizes repetition in a selection of famous songs; a prominent “Visit GlglStats” link (`https://glglstats.geekip.dev`); and below that, a secondary link with a small play icon: “Watch the PyData TLV talk” (`https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo`). A thin sparkline‑like SVG pattern in the background suggests repetition patterns. At the bottom of the card, in smaller italic text, a tarot‑style “insight” that changes on reload, e.g., “When patterns repeat, they whisper the structure of culture.”

The “Ahuzat Dibuk” card is styled like an urban map tarot. The background of the card shows a faint, stylized street grid of Tel‑Aviv with glowing heatmap blobs. The title: “Ahuzat Dibuk · The Parking Seer.” The core text describes it as a Python scraping and data visualization project that collects statistics on Tel‑Aviv parking lot occupancy and generates heatmaps to help residents find parking. Underneath, three stacked links: “News story on Channel 13” (`https://13tv.co.il/item/news/domestic/internal/parking-902956407/`), “Nexter coverage” (`https://www.mako.co.il/nexter-news/Article-ae43964b891bf71027.htm`), and “Original Facebook post” (`https://www.facebook.com/groups/secrettelaviv/posts/10159636301195943/`). Each link can be accompanied by a small icon (TV, article, Facebook). A rotating tooltip‑style insight text sits near the bottom: “Where others see chaos, data finds a spot.”

The “2D Part Orienting” card leans into geometric minimalism. Its border is composed of clean, sharp line segments forming polygons and arrows indicating motion. In the center of the front face, an abstract polygon being “pushed” by ghostly hands; on the back, the title: “2D Part Orienting · The Geometric Mechanic.” The text describes it as a C++ implementation in an open‑source computational geometry library of an efficient algorithm that constructs a push plan to orient a polygon. Below is a clear “Explore the project” link (`https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/`). The background of the card subtly animates, showing a polygon rotating through a few orientations as if following a push plan. The tarot insight line might read: “Every object can be guided into place, if you know where to push.”

“The Turing Jest” card embraces playful, neon humor. The border is decorated with speech bubbles, jester hats, and `LLM` tokens. The header text: “The Turing Jest · The Pun Arena.” The descriptive paragraph: this is an LMSYS‑like arena where large language models compete at making and explaining puns, and users rate the answers. A large button‑style link reads “Enter the Jest Arena” (`https://jest.geekip.dev`). Underneath, a randomly generated example pun snippet (short and safe, or placeholder text) appears each load, styled like a chat bubble between “Model A” and “Model B,” hinting at the interaction. The insight text: “To test intelligence, ask for laughter.”

The “Rhymes of Israel” card is styled like a parody newspaper front page. The top banner of the card mimics a news masthead; the main image area shows a stylized, handwritten “yearbook scribble” over a fake headline. Title: “Rhymes of Israel · The Headline Bard.” The explanatory text states that it is a Chrome extension using an LLM to rewrite Israeli news headlines into comedic rhymes in the style of a high school yearbook. The main link: “Install the Chrome Extension” (`https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eainginjgdkpgolpjniijdihfbeeeklb`). Below that, a small example layout shows one “serious” headline and a “rhymed” version, blurred or placeholder to avoid real content, just to suggest the transformation. The insight: “When headlines rhyme, the news becomes a diary of the absurd.”

One card is explicitly meta: the portfolio site itself. The front shows an ouroboros made from a line of code (e.g., `{ site = generate(site) }` curling into a circle). The back title: “The Ever-Changing Portfolio · The Recursive Mirror.” The body text says this is a portfolio website project that redesigns itself daily, using AI to remix its structure and aesthetic, and that you are currently looking at it. A prominent self-reference link: “Visit geekip.dev” (`https://geekip.dev`). Underneath, a short note: “Today’s layout is a tarot‑inspired edition; tomorrow’s may be something entirely different.” The insight line: “The code that looks at itself learns faster.”

The final card is the “Network Constellation” card, dedicated to social links. The imagery is constellations where each star is an icon. The title: “Network Constellation · Connections & Collaborations.” The content is three horizontally (or vertically on mobile) aligned, icon‑labeled links: “GitHub · github.com/gevak”, “LinkedIn · linkedin.com/in/gevakip”, and “Facebook · facebook.com/geva.kipper”. Each link is encased in a pill‑shaped button with a faint glow on hover. A brief line above them: “Trace the orbits where Geva’s work and collaborations continue.” The tarot insight: “No project exists alone in the sky.”

The overall card layout is responsive. On larger screens, the user sees the tarot spread with three cards foregrounded and the rest placed around in a slightly rotated, layered fashion. When a card is clicked, it flips and zooms slightly forward, dimming the background and other cards, almost like a modal but still clearly part of the spread. A small breadcrumb at the bottom of the visible card can display which “position” the card has in the current reading (“Present · Drawn second”), randomized each load. On smaller screens, the cards become a vertical stack; the top of the screen still shows Geva’s name and subtitle, and then a swipeable card interface lets users flip and expand each tarot card, with the “Draw Again” button reordering the stack.

At the very bottom of the single page, below the tarot altar, a slim, full‑width footer bar rests on a slightly darker band. On the left side, small, understated text: “Concept and layout generated by OpenAI’s GPT‑4.1.” On the right side, a digital stopwatch display reads something like `Time since 2025‑11‑16 01:10:45: 00:00:00`, with the numbers smoothly counting up in real time in hours, minutes, and seconds. The font is a monospaced, terminal‑like style, with a faint neon glow to connect it to the rest of the visual language. Hovering over the stopwatch reveals a tooltip: “This site has been evolving for this long.” The combination of tarot visuals, code motifs, dynamic randomness, and the ever‑ticking stopwatch reinforces the central idea: a living, AI‑touched portfolio where projects are revealed like cards in a reading, and time and code continuously reshape the experience.
