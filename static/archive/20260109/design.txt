**Visual Style & Atmosphere**
The website simulates a top-down, isometric view of a cozy, dimly lit "Developer’s Sanctum" rendered in high-fidelity pixel art (16-bit aesthetic). The color palette should feature deep, soothing purples and midnight blues for the background, illuminated by glowing accents of neon cyan, amber, and terminal green coming from various screens and gadgets within the room. A subtle "scanline" overlay and occasional CSS glitch effects should be applied to the edges of the screen to reinforce the theme that the site is an AI-generated construction.

**The HUD (Header & Introduction)**
Instead of a traditional header, use a floating "Game HUD" at the top left of the screen, styled like an RPG character status bar.
*   **Avatar:** A small, animated pixel-art portrait of Geva wearing a headset.
*   **Nameplate:** "Player: Geva Kipper" in a retro blocky font.
*   **Status/Class:** "Software Engineer @ Google" displayed as a status effect under the name.
*   **System Message:** A scrolling marquee or notification bubble next to the avatar reads: *"System Alert: This environment is procedurally re-designed daily by AI. Current iteration loaded."*

**The Interactive Room (Main Content Area)**
The center of the page is the isometric room. The user does not scroll down a list; instead, they explore the room. When the cursor hovers over specific items, the item glows and pop-up text identifies the project. Clicking an item creates a modal overlay styled like an RPG dialogue box (dark background, white pixel text, typing animation) containing the project details, links, and embedded media.

**The Furniture (Project Mapping)**
The room contains six distinct interactive zones representing the six projects:

1.  **The Vintage Jukebox (GlglStats):**
    *   *Visual:* A 1980s jukebox with colorful lights pulsing to a silent beat.
    *   *Interaction:* Clicking opens a music-player interface. On the left, a summary of the LZ77 repetition algorithm; on the right, the embedded PyData YouTube video and a "Play" button that links to the GlglStats website.

2.  **The Digital Window (Ahuzat Dibuk):**
    *   *Visual:* A large window looking out onto a pixelated Tel-Aviv skyline at night. Tiny cars can be seen circulating a parking lot.
    *   *Interaction:* The modal displays a heat map graphic. It describes the parking scraper project and includes three distinct buttons (styled as newspaper clippings) linking to the news stories on Channel 13, Mako, and the Facebook post.

3.  **The Blueprint Table (2D Part Orienting):**
    *   *Visual:* A slanted architect’s drafting table covered in geometric shapes and a robotic arm holding a polygon.
    *   *Interaction:* The modal looks like a technical blueprint. It explains the C++ algorithm for the push plan and provides the link to the Tel Aviv University project page.

4.  **The Arcade Cabinet (The Turing Jest):**
    *   *Visual:* A glowing arcade machine named "Jest Fighter" with two joysticks. The screen shows "Human vs AI".
    *   *Interaction:* The modal mimics a game high-score screen. It explains the LMSYS-like arena for puns and includes a large "Insert Coin to Play" button that links to the Turing Jest site.

5.  **The Bookshelf (Rhymes of Israel):**
    *   *Visual:* A tall library shelf. One specific book is glowing gold. A high school yearbook is visible on a lower shelf.
    *   *Interaction:* The modal opens like a book. It describes the comedic Chrome extension and includes a "Download Extension" bookmark linking to the Chrome Web Store.

6.  **The Holographic Mirror (Portfolio Meta-Link):**
    *   *Visual:* A futuristic standing mirror in the corner that doesn't reflect the room, but instead shows raw HTML code scrolling vertically (Matrix style).
    *   *Interaction:* The modal reads "RECURSION DETECTED." It explains that this project is self-referential and provides the link to geekip.dev.

**The Connectivity Station (Social Links)**
On the developer's main desk, alongside a multi-monitor setup, sits a **Retro PC Terminal**. Clicking the terminal opens a green-screen DOS interface listing the links.
*   **GitHub:** Represented by a pixelated Octocat icon.
*   **LinkedIn:** Represented by a briefcase icon.
*   **Facebook:** Represented by a thumbs-up icon.

**The Footer (System Footer)**
The bottom of the viewport features a fixed "System Bar."
*   **Left Side:** A small command-line prompt text reading: *"Architect: AI Model [Model Name]. Build successful."*
*   **Right Side:** A digital alarm clock font in bright red. It acts as a stopwatch counting up (Hours:Minutes:Seconds) labeled "TIME SINCE SINGULARITY (2026-01-09 01:14:01)." This timer updates live via JavaScript.
