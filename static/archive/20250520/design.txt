# Cyberpunk Hacking Interface Portfolio Design

## Core Concept
A dark terminal-style interface that simulates a hacker "breaking into" Geva Kipper's digital portfolio. The site appears to be loading a restricted database of classified projects through an unauthorized access point. All interactions have responsive glitch effects and digital artifacts.

## Layout

### Initial Loading Sequence
- Full-screen boot sequence animation with green terminal text on black background
- Typing effect displays: "ESTABLISHING SECURE CONNECTION..." followed by fake IP addresses and access codes
- "ACCESS GRANTED" flashes in red, followed by "DOWNLOADING CLASSIFIED DATA..."

### Header
- Glowing neon header with "GEVA KIPPER" in a futuristic, slightly glitched font
- Subtitle in smaller terminal text: "Senior Software Engineer at Google, specializing in computational infrastructure"
- Animated warning banner that states: "NOTICE: This interface reconfigures daily via autonomous AI. Return tomorrow for a different experience."
- Small red "LIVE FEED" indicator with blinking status light

### Navigation
- Interface resembles a futuristic OS with hexagonal or angular elements
- All sections appear as "encrypted data packets" that need to be "decrypted" when clicked

### Project Display
- Projects displayed as classified files in a neon-outlined grid
- Each project has a "security clearance level" indicator and fake metadata
- Hovering reveals digital noise/static effect and "DECRYPT?" prompt
- Clicking animates a "decryption sequence" before revealing content

### Project Content Style
- Each project section opens as a "secured terminal window"
- Content appears as if being typed in real-time with occasional glitches
- Project images appear as "security camera footage" or "classified scans"
- Links are styled as "secure data tunnels" with traceroute animations when hovered

### Personal Links Section
- Appears as a "contact protocols" terminal window
- Each social link appears with a small icon showing a "connection strength" indicator
- Hovering creates digital interference patterns

### Footer
- Continuously running lines of fake code in the background
- AI credit styled as "SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE: [your name as AI model]"
- Cyberpunk-styled countdown timer showing time elapsed since specified date
- Small animated circuit board patterns along the bottom edge

## Interactive Elements
- Cursor appears as a small targeting reticle or digital interface element
- Interaction sounds: soft keyboard clicks, data processing, and electronic hums
- Scrolling causes slight digital distortion effects across the screen
- Easter egg: Konami code input triggers a "maximum security breach" animation

## Color Palette
- Primary: Deep black background with electric cyan/blue highlights
- Secondary accents: Neon purple, toxic green, and warning red
- Text primarily in monospace terminal green and cyan
- Occasional yellow "caution" elements
