# Chatbot Terminal Portfolio Design

## Overall Aesthetic
The entire page mimics a retro terminal interface merged with a modern chat application. The background is a deep navy gradient (#0a0e27 to #1a1f3a) with subtle animated matrix-style falling characters in the background using the Hebrew alphabet mixed with code symbols, barely visible at 5% opacity. The interface uses a monospace font (Fira Code) for code elements and Inter for readable text.

## Header Section
At the top, a blinking cursor precedes the name "GEVA KIPPER" in large, bright cyan (#00d9ff) terminal-style text with a subtle glow effect. Below it, in smaller green (#00ff41) text with a typing animation that plays on page load: "Senior Software Engineer @ Google — Building infrastructure for large-scale machine learning systems." 

Immediately underneath, in italicized amber text (#ffb86c) with a refresh icon that slowly rotates: "⟳ This portfolio is redesigned daily by AI — you're viewing today's generation"

## Chat Interface Core
The main content area is styled as a sleek chat window with rounded corners and a subtle glass-morphism effect (semi-transparent white background with backdrop blur). On the left side is a narrow sidebar showing a simplified "AI Assistant" avatar (a geometric hexagon with pulsing gradients cycling through cyan, purple, and green).

## The Six Project Boxes
Each project appears as a chat message bubble from the AI assistant, alternating between left-aligned (projects 1, 3, 5) and right-aligned (projects 2, 4, 6) to create visual rhythm. Each bubble has:

- A gradient border (unique color scheme per project: GlglStats uses purple-pink, Ahuzat Dibuk uses orange-red, 2D Part Orienting uses blue-teal, Turing Jest uses yellow-green, Rhymes of Israel uses red-violet, Portfolio uses rainbow gradient)
- A semi-transparent dark background with subtle hover animation that brightens and expands slightly
- Project title in bold with an emoji prefix (🎵 for GlglStats, 🚗 for Ahuzat Dibuk, 📐 for 2D Part Orienting, 😂 for Turing Jest, 📰 for Rhymes, 🌐 for Portfolio)
- Description text that appears to type out when scrolled into view
- Links styled as terminal commands in brackets with hover effects: [LAUNCH_SITE], [WATCH_TALK], [READ_NEWS], [VIEW_CODE], [INSTALL]

Each bubble includes a small "Ask me more about this →" button at the bottom that, when clicked, expands to show a pre-written AI response with additional technical details and tech stack information.

## Interactive Input Box
At the bottom of the chat interface, before the social links, there's a functional text input field styled as a terminal command line with the prompt "root@geva:~$". Users can type questions, and a simple keyword-based chatbot responds with canned answers about Geva's work, skills, and projects. The responses appear as new chat bubbles with a brief typing indicator animation (three bouncing dots).

## Social Links Section
The seventh box appears as a system message in the center with a different styling—a darker background with a subtle grid pattern. Three large icon buttons (GitHub octocat, LinkedIn logo, Facebook icon) are arranged horizontally, each with a neon underglow effect in their respective brand colors that intensifies on hover.

## Footer Credits
At the very bottom, in small monospace text centered on the page: "Generated by Claude (Anthropic) on [current date] | Uptime: [HH:MM:SS counter]" where the counter uses a digital clock font and counts up from 2025-11-11 01:07:09 in real-time, with the numbers flickering subtly every second in bright green terminal text.

## Animations & Interactions
- Smooth scroll snapping to each project bubble
- Parallax effect on the background Hebrew matrix characters
- Hover effects that create ripple animations from the cursor position on each bubble
- Occasional randomized "system notifications" that briefly appear in the top-right corner with fun facts about Geva (dismissed automatically after 4 seconds)
- The chat input has auto-complete suggestions that dropdown when typing, showing common questions
