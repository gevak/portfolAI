### Portfolio Design: "The K-Map" (Kipper-Map)

The website is a single-page, infinite-canvas experience. The background is a living, breathing piece of generative art derived from the keywords of the resume (e.g., "Python," "LLM," "Geometry," "Data"). It is not a static image, but a slowly shifting field of abstract shapes, particle systems, and connecting lines, subtly animated. Each day, the color palette and structural form of this artwork are regenerated, making the site's aesthetic truly unique every 24 hours. The overall feel is dark, elegant, and technological, like observing a beautiful, complex system in a digital cosmos.

**On-Load Experience:**

The page loads to a central view of the generative art. Front and center, in a clean, sharp, white sans-serif font, is the name:

**Geva Kipper**
Currently building the next generation of Search at Google.

Directly below, in a slightly smaller, glowing ethereal font (perhaps a soft cyan or magenta, matching a highlight color from the day's generated art), is the subtitle:

*This digital canvas is procedurally generated by an AI each day, its form and color seeded by the contents of my resume. What you see is a unique, one-day-only piece of art.*

An understated, pulsating chevron or scroll indicator at the bottom of the screen invites the user to begin their journey.

**Navigation & Interaction:**

The user does not scroll down a traditional page. Instead, scrolling pans and zooms the camera across the 2D canvas of the generative art, traveling from one "node" of interest to the next. Each of the six projects is a distinct, brighter cluster or constellation within the larger artwork. As the user scrolls, the view smoothly glides to the next project node.

**The Six Project Sections:**

When the viewport centers on a project node, a semi-transparent, dark glass panel materializes near it. The content is not boxed in with hard lines, but appears to float on this panel. The edge of the panel closest to the art-node gently glows with a color specific to that project.

1.  **GlglStats:** The panel materializes next to a pulsating, data-stream-like formation in the artwork.
    *   Title: **GlglStats**
    *   Description: A Python project measuring the repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression, with visualizations of repetition patterns in famous tracks.
    *   Links: The links are not plain text. They are interactive icons. A "Live Site" icon (a stylized globe), and a "Watch Talk" icon (a play button). On hover, the icons glow brighter and a text label appears next to them.

2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk:** The camera pans to an area of the art that resembles a grid or a heatmap.
    *   Title: **Ahuzat Dibuk**
    *   Description: Python-based data scraping and visualization of Tel-Aviv parking lot occupancy, generating heatmaps to help residents find parking.
    *   Links: Three icons appear: two "News Story" icons (a newspaper) and one "Original Post" icon (a Facebook 'f' logo), each leading to their respective link.

3.  **2D Part Orienting:** The view shifts to a section with sharp, geometric, and crystalline structures.
    *   Title: **2D Part Orienting**
    *   Description: C++ implementation of an efficient algorithm for constructing a 'push plan' to orient a polygon, contributed to an open-source computational geometry library.
    *   Links: A single "View Code & Paper" icon (a `< >` symbol).

4.  **The Turing Jest:** The camera moves to a vibrant, chaotic-looking cluster of particles that suggests conversation or competing ideas.
    *   Title: **The Turing Jest**
    *   Description: An LLM arena where transformer models compete to create and explain puns. User ratings determine the wittiest AI.
    *   Links: A "Visit Arena" icon (a stylized comedy/tragedy mask).

5.  **Rhymes of Israel:** The journey takes us to a formation that looks like flowing text or ticker tape.
    *   Title: **Rhymes of Israel**
    *   Description: A Chrome extension leveraging an LLM to rewrite Israeli news headlines into comedic rhymes, in the style of a high-school yearbook.
    *   Links: An "Install Extension" icon (a Chrome logo puzzle piece).

6.  **The Portfolio (Meta):** For the final project, the camera zooms out slightly to show the interconnectedness of all the previous project nodes.
    *   Title: **This Website**
    *   Description: A meta-project; a single-page portfolio designed as a unique piece of generative art, re-imagined daily by an AI.
    *   Links: A "View Source (You are here)" link, represented by a circular arrow icon.

**Footer & Final View:**

After the sixth project, a final scroll zooms the camera all the way out, revealing the entire generative "Kipper-Map" in its full glory. At the bottom of the screen, floating above the art, the final elements fade in.

*   Center: Three minimalist, glowing icons for **GitHub**, **LinkedIn**, and **Facebook**.
*   Below the icons, in a small, monospaced font:
    *   `Design procedurally generated by an OpenAI Model.`
    *   `Time since genesis: [A live-updating stopwatch showing HHH:MM:SS since 2025-09-06 01:01:04]`
