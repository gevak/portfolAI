### Website Design: The Procedurally Generated Dungeon of Geva Kipper

This design envisions the portfolio as a single-page, vertical-scrolling 8-bit RPG dungeon. The user's scroll action is their method of "exploring" downwards into the dungeon, with each major section of the page representing a new room or level. The overall aesthetic is dark, mysterious, and styled after classic 16-bit era RPGs like Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy, but with a modern, clean execution.

**The Grand Entrance (Initial Viewport)**

The page opens at the mouth of a stone-carved dungeon. The background is a static, beautifully pixelated image of a starlit sky over jagged mountains, with the dungeon entrance in the foreground. Torches with gently flickering animated flames flank the entrance.

In the center, the name **Geva Kipper** is rendered in a bold, decorated 8-bit font, reminiscent of a game's title screen. Below it, in a simpler, clean pixel font, is the sentence: "A Software Engineer at Google, crafting worlds both real and virtual."

Directly beneath this, a text box appears, styled like an in-game system notification with a semi-transparent black background and a blinking cursor icon:

`> System Message: This dungeon is procedurally redesigned by a rogue AI each day. Layout and aesthetics may vary.`

At the very bottom of the initial view, a small, 8-bit avatar of Geva stands at the top of a stone staircase leading down into darkness. Next to him, a pixelated signpost with a softly pulsing down-arrow simply says "Descend."

**The Descent (Scrolling Experience)**

As the user scrolls down, the page doesn't just move; it creates the illusion of descent. The Geva avatar animates, walking down the staircase that winds its way down the center of the screen. The stone walls of the dungeon scroll by on either side, occasionally decorated with pixel-art details like moss, cracks, or glowing crystals. Each project section is a "room" or chamber that the staircase passes through. When a section is in the center of the viewport, the Geva avatar stops, and the content for that room becomes the focus.

**The Chambers of Creation (Project Sections)**

Each of the six project sections is presented within its own unique "dungeon room." The Geva avatar stands beside a central interactive element in the room, drawing attention to it. The textual information and links appear in a clean, modern modal-style box that overlays part of the room when it's in focus, ensuring readability.

1.  **The Chamber of Echoes (GlglStats):** The staircase opens into a cavern filled with large, glowing crystals. The central element is a massive, pulsing crystal that emits pixelated musical notes. The project description appears, and links to the site and video are presented as selectable, glowing runes on the cavern wall.

2.  **The Overlook of Ahuzat Dibuk:** This room is a balcony cut into the side of the dungeon, offering a view of a sprawling, 8-bit city of Tel Aviv at night. The interactive element is a telescope. The project description explains the parking project, with the heat-map concept visualized as certain buildings in the pixel-art city glowing red. The links to news articles and the Facebook post are styled as ancient scrolls on a nearby stone table.

3.  **The Forge of Geometry (2D Part Orienting):** This chamber resembles a dwarven forge. The Geva avatar stands next to an anvil where an animated, glowing 8-bit hammer rhythmically strikes a piece of metal, slowly shaping it into a complex polygon. The project description details the C++ algorithm, and the link to the code is presented as a schematic etched into the stone wall behind the anvil.

4.  **The Jester's Arena (The Turing Jest):** A grand, circular room with a throne at one end. Two pixel-art robot heads sit on pedestals, facing each other as if in debate. The throne is the central element. The project description details the LLM competition, and the link to the site is on a royal banner hanging above the throne.

5.  **The Scribe's Library (Rhymes of Israel):** This room is a circular library with towering shelves filled with books. The Geva avatar stands at a lectern in the center, which holds a large, open book. An animated quill magically writes rhyming headlines onto the book's pages. The project description appears, and the link to the Chrome extension is an illuminated icon of a quill that the user can click.

6.  **The Hall of Mirrors (Portfolio Website):** The final project room. This is a simple, elegant hall with an ornate, gilded mirror as its centerpiece. When the user scrolls here, the Geva avatar looks into the mirror. Instead of a reflection, the mirror's surface ripples and displays the meta-description of the portfolio project itself. The self-referential link is the frame of the mirror, which glows when hovered over.

**The Treasure Trove & Credits (Footer)**

After the last project, the staircase ends. The Geva avatar stands before a massive, overflowing treasure chest in a final, ornate chamber.

*   **The Chest:** The social links are presented as loot. A GitHub logo is embossed on a silver shield, the LinkedIn logo on a valuable blue amulet, and the Facebook logo on a leather-bound tome, all sitting atop piles of pixel-art gold coins inside the chest. Hovering over an item causes it to glint.

Below the treasure room, the screen fades to black for the final footer. Two lines of text appear in a simple, white pixel font:

`This ever-changing dungeon was designed and built by a Generative AI.`
`Time Since Last Cataclysm: 0h 0m 0s` (This text is paired with a live, ticking stopwatch counting up from 2025-07-21 01:17:28).
