# Blockchain Portfolio Design Concept for Geva Kipper

## Overall Theme
A simulated blockchain interface where each project is represented as a block in a chain. The design will use a dark mode aesthetic with vibrant accent colors (blockchain green, coding blue, and minimal white text).

## Header
- Large, bold display of "GEVA KIPPER" in a modern monospace font at the top
- Immediately below: "Senior Software Engineer at Google, building tools that shape the future of search"
- Subtitle in a slightly smaller font: "This portfolio is redesigned daily by AI - what you see today will evolve tomorrow"

## Blockchain Visualization
- A vertically arranged chain of 5 connected blocks
- Each block has a hexagonal shape with subtle gradient backgrounds
- Blocks are connected by animated lines with small particles flowing through them, suggesting data movement
- Each block has a simulated "hash" at the top and timestamp to maintain the blockchain metaphor
- Blocks expand with a smooth animation when clicked/hovered

## Individual Block Content
1. **GlglStats Block**
   - Icon: Musical waveform visualization
   - Title: "GlglStats"
   - Brief description with emphasis on LZ77 compression
   - Animated visualization sample that mimics the actual project output
   - Two buttons: "View Project" and "Watch Conference Talk" that link to the provided URLs

2. **Ahuzat Dibuk Block**
   - Icon: Parking lot/car symbol with data points
   - Miniature heat map visualization as background
   - Three distinct buttons for the news stories and Facebook post
   - Small animated car that moves across the block on hover

3. **2D Part Orienting Block**
   - Icon: Geometric polygon shape
   - Subtle animation showing a polygon being oriented through pushing
   - C++ code snippet as a decorative element in the background
   - Link to the project with a "View Algorithm" button

4. **Portfolio Website Block** (Meta Block)
   - Icon: Recursive digital frame/window
   - Self-referential design with miniature version of the blockchain inside
   - Infinity mirror effect when hovering
   - "You are here" indicator with pulsing dot
   - Link to the deployed site

5. **Contact Block**
   - Icon: Network node connections
   - Social media links displayed as connected nodes
   - Each platform has its brand color and icon
   - Hover effects that make each link glow

## Interactive Elements
- Mouse trail effect that leaves temporary "hash" strings behind cursor
- Smooth scrolling between blocks when navigating
- When hovering between blocks, the connection lines become more active
- Light terminal-style typing animation for text elements when they come into view

## Footer
- Elegant credit line: "Design generated by Claude AI"
- Live stopwatch counting time since April 25, 2025, with a retro digital clock aesthetic
- Small blockchain icon that pulses with each second

## Responsive Behavior
- On mobile, blockchain transforms to horizontal scrolling experience
- Blocks stack vertically on narrow screens but maintain connection animations
- Touch interactions replace hover effects

## Technical Notes
- Implemented with CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
- Animations handled through CSS transitions and JavaScript for more complex behaviors
- Custom WebGL effects for particle flows between blocks
- Local storage to remember which blocks were expanded in previous visits
