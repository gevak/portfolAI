The site opens with a full‑screen black background, styled to look like a terminal window. The primary color scheme is neon green monospace text, with subtle ASCII‑style accents such as gridlines, blinking cursors, and faint scanline/glitch effects. Small animated green code “rain” flows slowly down the edges of the screen à la *Matrix*, but only along the frame, leaving the center clean and legible.  

At the very top, in large hacker‑terminal text, the developer’s name appears: **“> Geva Kipper”**, as if typed out in real time letter by letter with a blinking cursor effect. Below it, a single green‑typed line states: *“Currently building large‑scale systems at Google.”* Directly beneath, in dimmer green italics, the subtitle fades into view: *“This website is re‑designed daily by AI — forever evolving.”*  

The content is laid out as a single scrolling page divided into clearly defined “terminal windows,” each a bordered black rectangle with green outlines and a glowing header bar. There are 7 such boxes stacked vertically, each separated by scrolling ASCII divider lines (e.g. `==========//==========`). Hovering over each box slightly brightens the green glow around it, mimicking terminal focus.  

**Box 1: GlglStats.** The header reads `[Project 1: GlglStats]` in bright green. Inside, a short sentence describes the Python project. Links are displayed as green underlined text with a `[link]` label, styled as if clickable terminal commands. The video is embedded within the box but framed in a neon‑green “CRT‑like” outline, as if it’s playing on an old terminal screen.  

**Box 2: Ahuzat Dibuk.** Header: `[Project 2: Ahuzat Dibuk]`. A short blurb explains the project. Three separate links are shown as `> news (13tv)`, `> news (Mako)`, `> original fb`. Hover states make them glitch momentarily before sharpening into crisp green.  

**Box 3: 2D Part Orienting.** Header: `[Project 3: 2D Part Orienting]`. Black panel with green‑text explanation, followed by a single link `> Learn More / Code`. Upon hover, the link animates a faint ASCII polygon diagram behind it.  

**Box 4: The Turing Jest.** Header: `[Project 4: The Turing Jest]`. A short description explains the LLM pun‑battle arena. The link `> jest.geekip.dev` appears as though typed out slowly by the system when scrolled into view.  

**Box 5: Rhymes of Israel.** Header: `[Project 5: Rhymes of Israel]`. A single witty line of green text explains the extension’s comedy purpose. Link is presented as `> Install Chrome Extension`. On hover, the text ripples as if made of ASCII rhymes.  

**Box 6: Portfolio Website (Meta).** Header: `[Project 6: This Website]`. The blurb acknowledges the recursion humorously: *“Self‑referential: a portfolio site about making this portfolio site.”*  
Link to `geekip.dev` is shown in exaggerated hacker prompt format:  
```
>>> open geekip.dev
```

**Box 7: Social Links.** Header: `[Contact / Social]`. Links to GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook are shown as `> github.com/gevak`, `> linkedin.com/in/gevakip`, `> facebook.com/geva.kipper`. On hover, each emits a faint green “pulse” ripple, like sonar pings in the terminal.  

At the bottom of the site is a footer section looking like a persistent system console. It states: *“// Site generated by AI model //”* in dimmed text. Beside it is a real‑time stopwatch, counting upward from **2025‑08‑22 01:05:07**, rendered as glowing green numbers updating live. A blinking underscore cursor follows the counter, reinforcing the terminal aesthetic.  

The overall design is minimal, ASCII‑styled, elegant but playful, staying true to the “green text on black hacker aesthetic” while using subtle modern CSS glow, animations, and glitch effects to keep it feeling cutting‑edge and interactive.
