# Lamp Genie Portfolio - Design Specification

## Overall Theme & Layout

The page opens to a mystical, deep purple-to-midnight blue gradient background with subtle, animated golden sparkles that drift slowly across the screen. At the center of the viewport sits an ornate, antique brass lamp rendered in CSS with metallic gradients and subtle embossing effects. The lamp has a gentle, pulsing golden glow emanating from its spout.

Above the lamp, in elegant serif typography with a golden shimmer effect, displays "Geva Kipper" with a tagline underneath in smaller, lighter text describing his current work at Google. Below this, in italicized script font with a mystical purple tint, appears the subtitle about the AI-redesigned website being ever-changing.

## Interaction Mechanism

A cursor approaching the lamp transforms into a hand icon. When users click and hold (or tap and hold on mobile) on the lamp, it begins to tilt and shake with smooth CSS animations. Wisps of glowing, animated smoke in iridescent colors (purples, blues, teals, and golds) begin spiraling out from the spout using particle-effect animations created with JavaScript canvas or CSS keyframes.

As the user continues to "rub" (hold), the smoke intensifies and swirls upward, gradually forming a translucent, ethereal genie figure made entirely of the colorful smoke particles. The genie rises above the lamp, grows to full height, then gracefully dissolves outward in all directions. As it dissipates, the smoke particles transform into six floating, magical carpet-styled cards that arrange themselves in two rows of three across the screen.

## Project Cards Design

Each card appears as a floating magic carpet with ornate Persian-style border patterns in gold thread on deep jewel-toned fabrics (ruby red, sapphire blue, emerald green, amethyst purple, topaz orange, and turquoise). The carpets have a subtle 3D perspective tilt and cast soft shadows on the background. They gently bob and sway with staggered CSS animations, creating the illusion of floating in mid-air.

**Card 1 (GlglStats)**: Ruby red carpet with musical note patterns woven into the borders. The project title appears in golden, embossed lettering. Below, concise description text in cream-colored typography. Two clickable golden lamp-shaped buttons labeled "Visit Project" and "Watch Presentation" sit at the bottom, each with a hover effect that makes them glow brighter.

**Card 2 (Ahuzat Dibuk)**: Sapphire blue carpet with car and parking symbol motifs. Three golden scroll-shaped buttons link to the two news stories and Facebook post, labeled "Channel 13," "Mako News," and "Original Post."

**Card 3 (2D Part Orienting)**: Emerald green carpet with geometric polygon patterns. Single golden geometric-shaped button linking to the project details with mathematical symbols subtly incorporated into the design.

**Card 4 (The Turing Jest)**: Amethyst purple carpet with comedy mask patterns and laugh symbols. The button is shaped like a jester's hat, linking to the jest arena site.

**Card 5 (Rhymes of Israel)**: Topaz orange carpet with Hebrew letter decorations and Chrome logo motifs. A browser extension icon-styled button invites users to "Install Extension."

**Card 6 (Portfolio Website)**: Turquoise carpet featuring recursive lamp imagery and infinity symbols. A mirror-like reflective button links to the site itself with text reading "You Are Here."

## Social Links Section

Below the six project carpets, a seventh, wider carpet in deep midnight blue unfurls horizontally. On it rest three ornate, golden bottles (reminiscent of genie vessels but smaller) arranged in a row. Each bottle is labeled and clickable: one etched with the GitHub octocat, one with the LinkedIn logo, and one with the Facebook icon. Hovering over each bottle causes golden smoke to puff from its cork with the corresponding social media color (GitHub: purple, LinkedIn: blue, Facebook: blue).

## Footer

At the very bottom, on a semi-transparent dark overlay that doesn't interfere with the magical atmosphere, elegant small text in golden color states the AI model credit. Beside it, a mystical hourglass icon sits with animated sand particles, accompanied by a digital counter showing hours, minutes, and seconds elapsed since October 26, 2025, 01:09:47. The numbers glow softly and increment in real-time.

## Responsive Behavior

On mobile devices, the lamp scales appropriately and the "rub" interaction works via touch-and-hold. The six carpets stack vertically in a single column, maintaining their floating animations but scaling to fit the narrower viewport. All interactive elements remain easily tappable with appropriate sizing.
