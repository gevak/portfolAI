# Terminal Portfolio Design: "GEVA_OS v2.0"

## Overall Concept & Visual Identity

The website presents itself as a retro-futuristic operating system boot sequence that has evolved beyond simple text. The background is a deep space black (#0a0a0f) with a subtle animated grid of faint cyan lines that slowly pulse, suggesting an active system. The entire page has a slight CRT screen curvature effect applied via CSS, with a very subtle scanline overlay and occasional screen flicker animation that triggers randomly every 30-60 seconds.

The primary color palette draws from classic terminal aesthetics but elevated: phosphor green (#33ff66) for primary text and commands, electric cyan (#00d4ff) for links and interactive elements, amber (#ffaa00) for warnings and highlights, and soft magenta (#ff66aa) for special accents. All text uses a monospace font stack: "JetBrains Mono" with "Fira Code" as fallback.

## Header & Introduction Sequence

Upon page load, a boot sequence animation plays: lines of system diagnostics rapidly scroll for 2 seconds ("INITIALIZING NEURAL CORES... LOADING PERSONALITY MATRIX... ESTABLISHING REALITY ANCHOR..."), then clear to reveal the main interface. The developer's name "GEVA KIPPER" appears as if being typed character by character in large ASCII art letters made of the = and | characters, approximately 80px equivalent height, centered at the top.

Below the ASCII name, in standard terminal text: ">> CURRENT_STATUS: Engineering @ Google | Building things that sometimes work" — this line has a blinking cursor at the end that persists throughout the user's visit.

Beneath this, a special styled block appears with a dashed border made of ~ characters: "⚠ NOTICE: This interface is procedurally regenerated daily by AI consciousness. What you see today will never exist again. Reality version: [current date]" — the date portion pulses gently.

## Command Line Interface

Below the header sits a functional command input field styled as a classic terminal prompt: "visitor@geva-os:~$ " followed by an input field with a blinking block cursor. When users type and press enter, commands trigger smooth scrolls to respective sections. Valid commands displayed in a subtle "hint" row below: "help | projects | glglstats | ahuzat | orienting | jest | rhymes | meta | connect | clear". Invalid commands return humorous error messages that fade after 3 seconds ("Error 418: I'm a teapot, not a mind reader. Try 'help'").

## Project Sections Layout

The six project boxes are arranged in a staggered asymmetric grid — two columns on desktop, but the boxes have varying heights and slight horizontal offsets (some pushed 20px left, others 20px right) creating visual rhythm. Each box appears to be a separate terminal window floating above the background, complete with a title bar showing a mock window control (three dots: red, yellow, green) and the project name.

### Box 1: GlglStats
Window title: "[ANALYSIS] glglstats.exe"
The box background features a subtle animated waveform visualization in very low opacity (10%) representing audio waves. Content displays as a file being read: "$ cat README.md" followed by the project description about measuring Israeli pop-chart repetitiveness using LZ77 compression. A small ASCII art music note decorates one corner. Links styled as executable commands: "[LAUNCH →]" for the site, "[WATCH PRESENTATION →]" for the YouTube video — the video link has a small play triangle icon made of ASCII characters (▶).

### Box 2: Ahuzat Dibuk
Window title: "[DATA] parking_analyzer.py"
This box has a miniature heat-map visualization in the background — a 5x5 grid of squares that slowly shift between green, yellow, and red, simulating parking lot occupancy. Description presented as Python-style comments (# lines). News links presented as a "media coverage" section with fake file paths: "/press/channel13.article", "/press/mako.feature". The Facebook link shows as "/origin/secret_tlv.post". Each link glows slightly brighter on hover.

### Box 3: 2D Part Orienting
Window title: "[GEOMETRY] orient_polygon.cpp"
The background contains a slowly rotating wireframe polygon (simple SVG animation, perhaps a pentagon) that demonstrates the concept of orientation. The description uses C++ syntax highlighting colors for certain terms. Code repository link styled as: "git clone [REPOSITORY]".

### Box 4: The Turing Jest
Window title: "[HUMOR_MODULE] jest_arena.exe"
This box has the most playful styling — occasional "ha" and "😄" characters float up from the bottom in very low opacity, like bubbles. The description is framed as an "arena scoreboard" aesthetic. A fake leaderboard snippet shows: "1. GPT-4: 847pts | 2. Claude: 839pts | 3. ???: You decide". Link styled as "[ENTER ARENA]".

### Box 5: Rhymes of Israel
Window title: "[CHROME_EXT] headline_poet.js"
The box includes a small mock browser address bar at the top showing "ynet.co.il" with the extension icon glowing. A before/after example shows a fake headline transformation with an arrow between them. The Chrome Web Store link has a small Chrome logo rendered in ASCII beside it.

### Box 6: Meta Portfolio
Window title: "[RECURSIVE] this_very_page.html"
This box has a subtle infinite mirror effect — a tiny representation of the entire page nested within it, which itself contains an even tinier version. Description acknowledges the self-referential nature with phrases styled as code comments. The link is styled uniquely: ">> CURRENT_LOCATION: You are here" with a pulsing dot.

### Box 7: Connect
Window title: "[NETWORK] social_links.config"
This final box is styled as a configuration file. Each link appears as a config entry:
```
GITHUB_HANDLE = "gevak" ............ [CONNECT]
LINKEDIN_PATH = "gevakip" .......... [CONNECT]  
FACEBOOK_USER = "geva.kipper" ...... [CONNECT]
```
The dots are animated, slowly cycling through dot patterns like a loading indicator.

## Footer Section

The footer sits at the very bottom, separated by a line of repeating ═ characters. Centered text reads: "// Interface rendered by Claude (Anthropic) | Model: Opus" with a small sparkle animation on "Claude". 

Below this, a live stopwatch component displays in larger monospace text: "SYSTEM UPTIME SINCE 2025-12-08 10:57:28" followed by a dynamically updating counter showing "XXXXd XXh XXm XXs" — each number segment is contained in its own subtle box, and the seconds actively count up, creating constant motion on the page. The entire counter has a subtle glow effect in cyan.

## Interactions & Micro-animations

All boxes have a "typed reveal" animation when they first enter the viewport — content appears character by character at high speed (50ms per character) as if being printed to terminal. Hovering over any box causes a subtle "selection" effect — a cyan border glow pulses once, and the box lifts slightly (transform: translateY(-4px)) with a soft shadow.

Links throughout change from their base color to white on hover, with the transition styled as a "glitch" — the text briefly offsets horizontally by 2px in alternating directions before settling.

The cursor throughout the page (when hovering over interactive elements) changes to a block cursor shape rather than a pointer, maintaining the terminal aesthetic.

## Mobile Adaptation

On mobile, the staggered grid becomes a single column. The command input transforms into a dropdown menu of sections for easier navigation. The ASCII art name scales down to a simpler text-based header. All terminal window chrome (the title bars with dots) remains but becomes more compact. The boot sequence shortens to 1 second.
