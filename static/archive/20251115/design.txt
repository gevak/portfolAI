The page opens on a dark, vertical canvas that feels like a launch pad at night. The background is a subtle gradient from deep navy at the bottom (ground) into a star-speckled purple-black at the top (space). A very thin, neon-like vertical line runs up the center of the page – this is the rocket’s trajectory and the spine of the timeline. The user scrolls downward to move “forward in time,” and as they scroll, the rocket icon anchored near the middle of the viewport subtly accelerates, leaving a faint, animated exhaust trail that lengthens with scroll speed. The background slowly transitions from ground-level silhouettes and soft city lights near the top, into high atmosphere blues, and finally into space with nebula textures and tiny parallax stars that drift slightly with scroll.

Above the fold, at the very top, is the “T‑0” hero section: a clean, centered block overlapping the central trajectory line. On the left of the line: a stylized, minimal rocket (flat, geometric, with a glassy, semi-transparent body and a glowing outline). On the right: text content. The developer’s name, “Geva Kipper”, appears in a refined, modern sans-serif, set large, with a thin weight and generous letter spacing, in white over the dark gradient. Beneath it, a single sentence in smaller but still prominent type: “Geva Kipper is a software engineer at Google, currently working on large-scale distributed systems.” Below that, in lighter weight and slightly italic, the subtitle: “This site is re‑designed each day by AI and is thus ever‑changing.” This subtitle has a subtle “glitch” effect that occasionally shifts the hue or slightly misaligns letters, hinting that the layout and visuals may shift between visits. At the bottom of the hero block, a slim pill-shaped “Scroll to Launch” hint subtly pulses, with a downward arrow aligned along the rocket’s trajectory line.

As the user begins to scroll, the rocket’s exhaust comes to life: small particles drift downward, and the central trajectory line brightens, as if current is running through it. Each milestone project appears as a “mission module” or “stage” attached to either the left or right side of the trajectory line, alternating sides to create a zig-zag timeline. Each module is a rounded-rectangle “box” with a soft glassmorphism style (semi-transparent, blurred background, thin light border) that feels like a floating control panel. When a module is centered in the viewport, it slightly scales up and its border glows, while the rocket “locks” next to it, suggesting the rocket is docking at that milestone.

The first major module is “GlglStats.” It is positioned not far below the hero, on the right side of the trajectory line. The title line reads “Mission: GlglStats” with a small, playful radar-like icon next to it. Underneath, a one- or two-sentence description: “Python project measuring the repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression, visualizing repetition patterns in a selection of famous songs.” Below the text, two prominent controls: a primary “Launch GlglStats” button linking to https://glglstats.geekip.dev and a secondary “Watch PyData TLV Talk” button linking to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo. The module background includes faint, animated waveforms and repeated bar motifs, echoing audio patterns. On hover, these patterns slowly pulse, and bar segments subtly repeat, visually reinforcing the concept of repetition. The video link can also show a thumbnail frame with a triangular play icon; clicking opens a modal overlay with the embedded YouTube talk, framed like a mission control monitor.

Scrolling further, on the opposite side of the rocket line, appears the “Ahuzat Dibuk” module. It’s styled like a miniature urban grid. The header reads “Mission: Ahuzat Dibuk” with a small icon of a parking “P” sign integrated into a heat-map gradient. The text describes: “Python scraping and data visualization project collecting statistics on Tel‑Aviv car parking lots occupancy, generating heat-maps to be used by residents.” Below, three inline link buttons: “News Story 1” linking to https://13tv.co.il/item/news/domestic/internal/parking-902956407/, “News Story 2” linking to https://www.mako.co.il/nexter-news/Article-ae43964b891bf71027.htm, and “Original Facebook Post” linking to https://www.facebook.com/groups/secrettelaviv/posts/10159636301195943/. Behind the glassy module surface, a faint animated map pattern slowly fades between cool blues and hot reds, like an occupancy heat-map. When the module is active in the center of the viewport, little pinpoints on this map softly twinkle.

The next milestone module, attached back on the right of the trajectory line, is “2D Part Orienting.” This module uses a more technical, geometric aesthetic. The header: “Mission: 2D Part Orienting” with a small polygon + arrow icon. The description: “C++ implementation in an open-source computational geometry library of an efficient algorithm for constructing a push plan to orient a given polygon.” Below, a single strong call-to-action button “Explore the Algorithm & Code” linking to https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/. The background of the module shows animated line-art polygons that slowly rotate and snap into alignment as if being oriented by invisible forces. As the user hovers, one polygon outlines in a luminous accent color and animates along a small path, like a “push plan” visualization.

After another short scroll, on the left, appears “The Turing Jest” as a more whimsical module. The header: “Mission: The Turing Jest” with a tiny jester hat icon over a stylized chip. The description: “An LMSYS-like arena where LLMs compete at making and explaining puns, and their answers are rated by users.” A main button labeled “Enter the Jest Arena” links to https://jest.geekip.dev. The module background has subtle comic speech bubbles and question marks drifting in and out. As the module becomes active, one speech bubble unrolls a short sample pun (randomized, or a static example), then fades. Hovering tilts the module slightly, like a playful card.

Next, further “up” the timeline, on the right, is the “Rhymes of Israel” module, styled like a ribboned headline. The header: “Mission: Rhymes of Israel” with an icon combining a news headline bar and a rhyming couplet mark. The description: “A Chrome extension that uses an LLM to rewrite Israeli news site headlines into comedic rhymes in the style of a high school yearbook.” A standout Chrome-style button “Install Chrome Extension” links to https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eainginjgdkpgolpjniijdihfbeeeklb. In the background layer, a standard headline in Hebrew or placeholder Latin text morphs into a playful, rhyming phrase via a subtle text cross-fade animation. On hover, the headline bar gently “wobbles” like a banner.

Higher still, on the left, is the meta module: the portfolio site itself. Header: “Mission: This Portfolio” with a small infinity or recursion icon. The description: “A self-referential portfolio website that turns Geva’s work into a rocket-powered timeline of launches and misfires, re-imagined daily by AI.” A button labeled “Visit geekip.dev” links to https://geekip.dev. The background is a faint mirror of the overall page aesthetic: miniature rockets, tiny timelines, and subtle reflections, hinting at recursion. The module copy can also include a short aside: “Yes, this section is about the site you’re currently scrolling through.”

Near the “top” of space, very close to the end of the trajectory, is the final module, centered more than offset, treating it like the rocket’s capsule. This is the contact / social box. The header: “Mission Control – Stay in Orbit” in a slightly larger font than the previous module titles. Below, three horizontally arranged icon + label buttons (stacking vertically on mobile): “GitHub” linking to https://github.com/gevak, “LinkedIn” linking to https://linkedin.com/in/gevakip, and “Facebook” linking to https://facebook.com/geva.kipper. Each button uses its brand color subtly, but harmonized through a desaturated filter to maintain elegance. Behind the module, faint, minimal icons of satellites and signals drift slowly. When the module is active, thin lines animate from the central rocket trajectory to each social icon, like data links.

Between these major modules, scattered along the trajectory line, are smaller, dimmer “failed launch” capsules. They are minimalist, semi-transparent circles or small cards with labels like “Aborted Prototype,” “Half-Baked Experiment,” “Idea that Never Left the Pad.” Each has a tiny icon (cracked rocket, broken gear, crossed-out star) and a one-line description placeholder. Their style is subdued: grayscale, blurred, and partially faded unless hovered. On hover, they sharpen and show a brief, witty description. These optional nodes are visually present enough to hint at the imperfect path behind the polished milestones, but understated so they don’t distract from the main seven modules.

The “AI re-designed each day” concept manifests in subtle generative variations: the primary accent color (used for rocket glow, button highlights, and module borders) cycles daily through a curated palette (e.g., teal, magenta, amber, electric blue), the background starfield pattern slightly shifts, and micro-shapes behind modules vary. A small text near the top, under the subtitle, can show: “Today’s AI design variation: #<seed>” in tiny, neutral text, reinforcing the idea without overwhelming. Shapes and colors shift via CSS variables and small JavaScript seeds, keeping the layout recognizable but the aesthetics “alive.”

At the very bottom of the page, beyond the last module, the rocket finally “exits” the viewport upward: as the user reaches the end, the rocket icon animates off the screen toward the top, leaving only the glowing trajectory fading out into the starfield. Here, on a calm, dark background, the footer sits as a narrow panel. On the left, a single line of text in small caps: “Site concept generated by OpenAI’s GPT‑4 class AI model.” On the right, styled like a mission time console, is the stopwatch labeled “Mission Elapsed Time since 2025‑11‑15 05:26:34” with a digital-style display next to it, showing “HH:MM:SS” and updating in real time using JavaScript. The digits glow softly in the current accent color, and a tiny blinking colon reinforces the live nature of the clock. This footer remains minimal and uncluttered, giving a quiet, reflective endpoint to the journey.

On mobile, the design collapses the alternating left-right modules into a single column centered under the rocket trajectory; the rocket icon shrinks and may pin to the top, with the trajectory line running slightly offset behind the modules. Animations are softened, and parallax is reduced or disabled for users with reduced motion preferences, keeping the experience smooth and accessible while preserving the core metaphor: a rocket accelerating through Geva’s milestones, past misfires and experiments, guided by an ever-shifting AI aesthetic.
