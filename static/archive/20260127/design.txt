**Global Visual Aesthetic & Atmosphere**
The website should feature a "Digital Void" background—a deep, almost black violet (#0a0215) that fades into pure black at the bottom. The entire page functions as a vertical parallax tunnel, creating the illusion that the user is falling deeper into a "technological rabbit hole" as they scroll. Overlay the background with a subtle, CRT monitor scan-line texture and floating geometric dust particles that drift upward. The color palette should utilize high-contrast neon teal, magenta, and electric white to create a chromatic aberration (3D glitch) effect on hover states.

**Typography & Cursor**
Use a stark pairing of fonts: a high-end serif font (reminiscent of the original Alice in Wonderland book) for headings, clashing with a raw, pixelated monospace terminal font for body text. The mouse cursor should be replaced by a custom graphic: a stylized "White Rabbit" wireframe. When the cursor moves, it should leave a trailing tail of binary code (0s and 1s) that fades out after a second.

**The Hero Section: "The Entrance"**
Center screen, Geva Kipper’s name appears in large, fractured serif typography. Every few seconds, the name should "glitch"—violently shifting RGB channels and briefly replacing letters with random symbols before resolving back to text. Below the name, display the sentence: "Currently engineering the future at Google." This text should type itself out like a terminal command.

Beneath the bio, place the AI subtitle: *"System Alert: This interface is re-architected daily by an autonomous AI. Structure is unstable."* This text should be wrapped in a yellow/black hazard tape border that looks slightly torn or corrupted.

**Main Layout: "The Spiral Down"**
Instead of a standard grid, the six project boxes are arranged in a loose, vertical helix (spiral) formation. As the user scrolls down, the boxes should appear to rotate entirely around the center axis, coming into focus from the depths of the screen.

**The Project Cards (The Glitched Windows)**
Each project box looks like a floating pane of frosted glass with a glowing border. On hover, the glass "cracks," and the content visibly shifts.

*   **Box 1: GlglStats (The Compression):** The visual for this card mimics a sound wave that is heavily compressed. When hovered, the wave expands and distorts. Include the link to the site and embed the YouTube video with a CSS filter that makes it look like a VHS recording.
*   **Box 2: Ahuzat Dibuk (The Heatmap):** The background of this card is a darkened map of Tel-Aviv. A thermal heatmap overlay pulses rhythmically. The links to the news stories and Facebook should look like "Redacted" government files that reveal the text when the cursor passes over them.
*   **Box 3: 2D Part Orienting (The Geometry):** This card features a rotating 2D polygon wireframe. As the user interacts, the polygon attempts to orient itself but occasionally glitches into static noise before snapping back to a perfect fit.
*   **Box 4: The Turing Jest (The Arena):** Split the card visually into two sides (Red and Blue) representing the opposing LLMs. The text describing the project should look like a dialogue chat log.
*   **Box 5: Rhymes of Israel (The Yearbook):** Style this card like a piece of newsprint turning into a digital popup. The header reflects a classic Hebrew newspaper font that morphs into a comedic, bubbly comic sans font on hover, symbolizing the "comedic rhymes."
*   **Box 6: The Meta Portfolio (Infinity):** This box features a screenshot of the *current website* inside it. Inside that screenshot is a smaller screenshot, creating a "Droste effect" (infinite mirror). The self-reference link should glow with a pulsing "recursion" animation.

**Section 7: Social Connectivity**
At the bottom of the spiral, the three links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Facebook) should be presented as three "Potion Bottles" or geometric artifact keys.
*   **GitHub:** A bottle containing floating code symbols.
*   **LinkedIn:** A bottle containing a structured, glowing network mesh.
*   **Facebook:** A bottle containing a "thumbs up" icon that flickers like a neon sign.

**The Footer: "The Stopwatch"**
The bottom of the page hits "Rock Bottom." A purely black footer with a single, blinking terminal cursor.
On the left: *"Site Architecture Generated by: [AI Model Name]."*
On the right: A large, ominous digital stopwatch font (bright red on black). It displays the elapsed time in `HH:MM:SS` format alongside the label *"TIME ELAPSED SINCE SINGULARITY EVENT (2026-01-27 01:18:35)."* If the current date is before 2026, the clock should count *backwards* with a negative sign; if after, it counts upwards. The milliseconds should race uncontrollably fast to add a sense of urgency.
