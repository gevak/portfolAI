**Visual Concept: The "Temporal Data Terminal"**

The overall aesthetic is a sleek, dark-mode "Scientific Containment Terminal" from a near-future sci-fi setting. The user is not just visiting a website; they have stumbled upon an active workstation left running by an AI. The background should be a deep, matte charcoal (almost black) with a subtle, slow-moving mesh network animation in the background that reacts to cursor movement, symbolizing a neural network.

The layout is a grid of "Encrypted Data Vaults" (the six boxes). The typography should mix clean, modern sans-serif (like Inter or Roboto) for body text with a monospaced font (like Fira Code) for headers and technical specs, giving it a coding environment feel.

**Header: The User Profile**
At the top left, display a "System User" card. It looks like a digital ID badge. It features **Geva Kipper**’s name in bold, illuminated text. Below it, a status line reads: *"Current Assignment: Software Engineering at Google"* accompanied by a pulsing green "Online" indicator.

To the right of the header, place the subtitle in a glitch-text style (where letters randomly swap for milliseconds before settling). It reads: *"Notice: This interface is actively re-designed each day by generative AI. Architecture is unstable."*

**Main Content: The Six Puzzle Vaults**
The core experience is a grid of six "Vaults." Each box initially looks like a high-tech, locked security panel. The content is visible but slightly obscured by a "frosted glass" CSS effect or a digital noise filter. To "Escape" or access the content clearly, the user must interact with the box, solving a micro-interaction that fits the theme of the project.

**Box 1: GlglStats (The Frequency Tuner)**
*   **Visual:** A panel displaying a compressed audio waveform that looks static and chaotic.
*   **Interaction:** The user sees a horizontal slider labeled "LZ77 Decompression Factor." As they slide it to the right, the static waveform smooths out into a clean, recognizable pop-music beat pattern.
*   **Content Reveal:** Once "decompressed," the text slides into focus explaining the Python project measuring repetitiveness in Israeli pop charts.
*   **Links:** Two glowing buttons appear: "Access Database" (Link to glglstats.geekip.dev) and "View Conference Data" (Link to the PyData YouTube video).

**Box 2: Ahuzat Dibuk (The Heatmap Scanner)**
*   **Visual:** A dark, monochromatic map of Tel-Aviv.
*   **Interaction:** The mouse cursor transforms into a "Thermal Spotlight" (a circle of light). As the user moves the mouse over the map, the spotlight reveals vibrant heat-map colors (red/yellow) indicating parking density, simulating the scraping of data.
*   **Content Reveal:** The text describes the Python scraping and data visualization for parking lots.
*   **Links:** Three "Evidence Files" drop down: "Report 13" (News 13 link), "Report Mako" (Mako link), and "Original Log" (Facebook link).

**Box 3: 2D Part Orienting (The Geometry Lock)**
*   **Visual:** A schematic blueprint background. In the center is a rotatable polygon shape inside a circular dial.
*   **Interaction:** The user must click and drag to rotate the polygon until it aligns with a silhouette outline (the "Push Plan"). When it snaps into place, the lock turns green with a mechanical *click* sound effect.
*   **Content Reveal:** The panel opens to reveal the C++ Computational Geometry project details.
*   **Link:** A "Source Blueprint" button linking to the TAU project page.

**Box 4: The Turing Jest (The Chat Terminal)**
*   **Visual:** A retro command-line interface (CLI) window with a blinking cursor.
*   **Interaction:** A prompt asks: *"Input Humor Request."* When the user hovers over the box, two chatbot avatars (representing the battling LLMs) slide in from the sides, typing rapidly.
*   **Content Reveal:** The text explains the LMSYS-style arena for puns.
*   **Link:** A pulsating prompt button "> ENTER ARENA" linking to jest.geekip.dev.

**Box 5: Rhymes of Israel (The Yearbook Decoder)**
*   **Visual:** A snippet of a serious-looking news headline in a boring serif font.
*   **Interaction:** A toggle switch labeled "High-School Yearbook Mode" sits at the top. Flipping the switch triggers a page-flip animation, transforming the boring font into a playful, handwritten style script, and the headline rewrites itself into a rhyme.
*   **Content Reveal:** Description of the Chrome extension that rhymes headlines.
*   **Link:** A sticker-style button "Add to Chrome" linking to the store.

**Box 6: The Recursion (The Meta-Window)**
*   **Visual:** A screen displaying the website itself (a screenshot of the current page).
*   **Interaction:** The "Infinity Mirror" effect. Moving the mouse creates a parallax effect where the screenshot inside the box moves, showing smaller and smaller versions of the site endlessly.
*   **Content Reveal:** Text explains: *"You are here. Recursion depth: 1."*
*   **Link:** A button labeled "Reload Loop" linking to geekip.dev.

**Section 7: External Comms (The Patch Panel)**
Located below the grid, this section looks like the physical back-panel of a server. It features three "ports" resembling cable inputs.
*   **Three Ports:** Labeled **GitHub**, **LinkedIn**, and **Facebook**.
*   **Visual:** When hovered, a virtual cable plugs into the socket, lighting up the icon in its respective brand color (Purple for GitHub, Blue for LinkedIn/FB).
*   **Links:** Connected to your respective profiles.

**Footer: The Anomalous Chronograph**
At the very bottom, centered, is a section distinctly separated by a hazard stripe.
*   **Credits:** Small monospace text: *"Site architecture generated by AI Model [Model Name]. Human supervision minimal."*
*   **The Stopwatch:** A large, digital segmented display (red LEDs).
*   **Logic:** It tracks the time passed since **2026-01-29 01:24:29**.
*   **Visual Twist:** Since the date is currently in the future relative to now (2024/2025), the stopwatch should display a negative counting *down*, or if viewed in the future, counting *up*. This should be labeled: **"TEMPORAL DRIFT DETECTED"**. This creates a mystery—why is the reference date in 2026? Is the site from the future?
