## Git Timeline Portfolio Design

The website presents as an interactive Git commit history visualization, featuring a central vertical timeline that resembles a Git branch diagram with commit nodes and connecting lines. The background is a dark code editor theme (#1e1e1e) with subtle syntax highlighting colors used as accents throughout.

At the top, "Geva Kipper" appears as a large, monospace font header styled like a Git repository name, followed by his Google work description in smaller text. Below this, the AI redesign subtitle appears as a Git commit message format: "feat: daily AI redesign - keeping portfolio fresh and evolving".

The main timeline flows vertically down the center of the page, with each of the five project sections represented as commit nodes branching off alternately to the left and right. Each commit node is a colored circle (using Git-inspired colors: green, blue, orange, purple, red) connected to its project box with animated dotted lines that draw themselves on scroll.

Each project box resembles a code diff or pull request card, with the project name as a commit hash-style header, followed by the description in a clean, readable font. Links are styled as clickable file paths with hover effects that simulate syntax highlighting. The GlglStats section includes an embedded video thumbnail, while Ahuzat Dibuk features a small data visualization preview.

The social links section at the bottom appears as a final "merge" commit, with three branching paths leading to minimalist icon-text combinations for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook.

At the very bottom, the AI credit and timestamp counter are displayed as footer comments in a monospace font, with the stopwatch updating in real-time using a retro digital clock aesthetic. The entire page features smooth scroll animations that reveal commit nodes progressively, creating an engaging journey through Geva's development timeline.
