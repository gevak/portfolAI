# Snow Globe Portfolio Design for Geva Kipper

## Overall Concept & Container

The entire viewport is dominated by a large, realistic 3D snow globe sitting on an ornate wooden base. The globe has a subtle glass refraction effect with a curved distortion at the edges. Inside the globe, gentle snowflakes continuously drift downward in a realistic physics simulation—they swirl slightly when the user moves their cursor, as if the globe is being gently shaken. The background behind the globe is a deep midnight blue gradient with soft, out-of-focus bokeh lights suggesting a cozy winter evening atmosphere.

## Header Area (Inside the Globe, Top Section)

At the top interior of the snow globe, "GEVA KIPPER" appears as elegant 3D metallic letters that catch light and cast subtle shadows onto the snowy landscape below. These letters appear to be a miniature sign or marquee standing in the snow. Beneath the name, in a delicate serif font etched into a tiny wooden signpost, reads: "Software Engineer crafting developer tools at Google." 

Just below this, on a small vintage-style brass plaque partially dusted with snow, the subtitle appears: "This portfolio is reimagined daily by AI—you're seeing today's unique creation."

## The Miniature Village Layout (Six Project Dioramas)

Inside the globe's base landscape sits a charming miniature winter village. The snowy ground has gentle rolling hills, and six distinct tiny buildings/structures are arranged in a loose semicircle, each representing a project. Users can click on any structure to "zoom into" that diorama—the view smoothly animates closer, the building grows larger, and a detailed information panel slides in from the side like an unfolding paper card.

### Diorama 1: GlglStats — The Music Box Theater
A tiny vintage music box theater with warm golden light spilling from its windows. Musical notes made of paper float above the roof. The miniature marquee displays "GLGLSTATS" in old-fashioned light bulbs. When hovered, the music box lid opens slightly and tiny gears turn. The expanded panel shows the project description about measuring Israeli pop-chart repetitiveness using LZ77 compression, with visualizations of famous song patterns. Links appear as vintage concert tickets—one ticket links to glglstats.geekip.dev, another styled as a film reel icon links to the PyData TLV YouTube presentation.

### Diorama 2: Ahuzat Dibuk — The Parking Garage
A miniature multi-story parking garage made of concrete and glass, with tiny LED indicators (green/red) on each level showing occupancy. A heat-map texture subtly glows on the structure's side. Tiny cars are frozen mid-entry. The expanded panel describes the Tel-Aviv parking data visualization project. Links appear as parking tickets or press badges linking to the 13tv news story, Mako article, and the Secret Tel Aviv Facebook post.

### Diorama 3: 2D Part Orienting — The Factory Workshop
A tiny industrial workshop with geometric shapes visible through frosted windows—polygons and mathematical diagrams. A small conveyor belt with abstract 2D shapes sits outside. Gears and mechanical elements adorn the exterior. The expanded panel explains the CGAL C++ algorithm implementation. A blueprint-style link card connects to the TAU CGL project page.

### Diorama 4: The Turing Jest — The Comedy Club
A small comedy club with a brick exterior, a neon "OPEN MIC" sign, and a tiny spotlight visible through the window. Comedy/tragedy masks hang by the door, and a small chalkboard outside shows "Tonight: LLMs Battle in Puns!" When hovered, you can hear a faint rimshot sound. The expanded panel describes the LMSYS-style LLM pun competition arena. A comedy ticket links to jest.geekip.dev.

### Diorama 5: Rhymes of Israel — The Newsstand Kiosk
A charming old-world newsstand with tiny newspapers and magazines. Headlines visible on the papers are written in playful rhyming text. A Chrome logo subtly integrated into the kiosk's awning hints at the extension nature. Quill pens and scrolls decorate the scene. The expanded panel describes the Chrome extension that transforms news into yearbook-style comedic rhymes. A Chrome Web Store badge links to the extension installation.

### Diorama 6: Portfolio Website — The Snow Globe Shop
A recursive delight: a tiny shop whose window display contains an even tinier snow globe, which contains an even tinier version of this whole scene (rendered as a texture suggesting infinite recursion). The shop sign reads "Curiosities & Portfolios." The expanded panel playfully acknowledges the meta-nature of this project. A small mirror-frame link connects to geekip.dev.

## Social Links Section — The Village Signpost

In the center of the village stands an old wooden directional signpost with three arrows pointing different directions, each carved with a social platform name and icon: GitHub (pointing to a tiny code repository cabin in the distance), LinkedIn (pointing toward distant office buildings on the horizon), and Facebook (pointing toward a cozy café). These are clickable and link to gevak's GitHub, gevakip's LinkedIn, and geva.kipper's Facebook respectively.

## The Globe's Base — Footer Area

The ornate wooden base of the snow globe has a small brass manufacturer's plaque. This plaque contains: "Designed by Claude (Anthropic) — an AI assistant" in elegant engraved typography. Below this, an antique flip-clock or mechanical counter displays the elapsed time since December 5, 2025, 01:08:25, showing hours, minutes, and seconds with satisfying mechanical flip animations as digits change.

## Interactions & Animations

- Cursor movement causes snowflakes to swirl gently in that direction
- Clicking and dragging rotates the view slightly within the globe (limited rotation, maintaining visibility of all dioramas)
- Hovering over any building causes it to glow warmly and rise slightly from the snow
- Clicking a building triggers a smooth zoom transition with depth-of-field blur on surrounding elements
- The glass of the globe has a subtle reflection of ambient light that shifts as users move their cursor
- Snowflakes accumulate very slowly on building roofs, resetting every few minutes
- Occasional ambient sounds: soft wind, distant music box melody, gentle chimes

## Color Palette & Typography

Colors are warm yet wintery: soft whites and pale blues for snow, warm amber and gold for building lights, deep navy for the background, brass and mahogany for the base. Typography uses a combination of elegant serif fonts for names and titles (suggesting hand-crafted signage) and clean sans-serif for body text in expanded panels. All text inside the globe has a subtle 3D quality as if physically existing in the miniature world.
