# Physics Playground Portfolio Design for Geva Kipper

## Overall Concept
A physics-based interactive playground where each project is represented by a physical object with unique properties. The entire page has a subtle grid backdrop reminiscent of graph paper, suggesting scientific precision while maintaining a playful aesthetic.

## Header
The top features "Geva Kipper" in a bold, modern sans-serif font that appears to be slightly affected by gravity, subtly bouncing when the page loads. Beneath it, a single elegant line states: "Software Engineer at Google, building intelligent systems that empower users."

Below this, a gently pulsing subtitle in a lighter weight: "This website is redesigned daily by AI and is never the same twice."

## Interactive Physics Playground
The main area resembles a minimalist physics sandbox with subtle depth cues. Visitors can use their cursor to grab, toss, spin, and play with five distinct objects representing each project. Each object leaves a faint, temporary trail as it moves, showing its trajectory.

## Project Objects

1. **GlglStats**: Represented by a colorful waveform sphere that pulses to an invisible beat. When clicked, it expands to reveal project details with playful audio visualizer elements in the background. The box features embedded links to the website and video.

2. **Ahuzat Dibuk**: A miniature 3D map/cube with dynamic heat-map coloring that shifts when interacted with. When expanded, it reveals parking data visualizations with subtle car animations moving around the edges. The news links appear as newspaper-style clippings.

3. **2D Part Orienting**: A geometric polygon that rotates and reorients itself when touched. The shape constantly tries to find its stable orientation, demonstrating the algorithm's purpose. When expanded, it shows code snippets and geometry visualizations.

4. **Portfolio Website**: A recursive mirror-like cube that shows a miniature version of the current website itself. When clicked, it creates a fun "infinity mirror" effect before expanding to show meta information about the site's creation.

5. **Social Links**: A interconnected network of nodes that gently pulse. Each node represents a different social platform with subtle iconography. When interacted with, connection lines between the nodes become more prominent.

## Physics Interactions
- Objects have realistic physics properties (mass, bounce, friction)
- They can collide with each other and the boundaries of the viewport
- Gravity can be temporarily toggled with a small floating switch
- Objects return to their approximate starting positions after being left alone for a few seconds
- A subtle "reset playground" button appears if things get too chaotic

## Aesthetic
Clean white background with subtle depth shadows. Accent colors are derived from a modern, cohesive palette that complements Google's design language while maintaining individuality. Typography is crisp and highly readable with appropriate hierarchy.

## Responsive Behavior
On mobile devices, the physics playground adapts to touch interactions, with objects becoming slightly larger for better touch targets. The layout reconfigures to a vertical column while maintaining all interactive elements.

## Footer
At the bottom, elegant text credits: "Site designed by Claude AI by Anthropic." Next to this, a stylized digital stopwatch continuously counts time elapsed since May 1, 2025, 01:10:18, with the digits having subtle "flip" animations like an old-school flip clock.
