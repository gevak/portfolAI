**Global Styling & Atmosphere**
The website should immediately plunge the user into a ridiculous, over-the-top "Hollywood hacker" movie scene. The background is a stark `#000000` pitch-black, overlaid with a faint, low-opacity scrolling "Matrix digital rain" effect utilizing Japanese kana and alphanumeric characters. Above the background, apply a global CSS overlay with CRT scanning lines, a subtle screen flicker via keyframe animations, and a slight radial vignette to simulate a glowing cathode-ray tube monitor. The global typography must be a heavy, glowing neon-green monospace font (such as VT323 or Fira Code) with a mild text-shadow (`0 0 5px #00FF41`) to simulate screen glare. Red (`#FF003C`) will be used sparingly for system alerts and critical highlights.

**Header & Main Identity**
At the top left of the screen, present a simulated terminal boot sequence. The text should appear using a JavaScript typing effect, revealing: `> INITIALIZING SECURE CONNECTION... OVERRIDE AUTHORIZED`. 
Below this, in massive ASCII-art style text or heavily bolded glowing font: **GEVA KIPPER**. 
Directly underneath, write the role with a blinking `_` cursor: `STATUS: Currently interfacing with the global mainframe as a Software Engineer at Google.` 
Opposite to this on the top right, enclosed in a flashing, hazard-striped ASCII border, is the subtitle/alert: `[SYSTEM ALERT]: This interface is dynamically recompiled and re-designed daily by AI. Expect morphological architecture shifts.`

**Layout Architecture**
The main content area should utilize CSS Grid or Masonry to arrange the seven "boxes." These shouldn't look like standard web cards; they should look like floating, draggable terminal windows or satellite feed displays. Each box must feature a fake ASCII border (e.g., `+=======+`) or a command-line title bar (e.g., `root@geekip:~/nodes/project-1_`). Hovering over any window should trigger a rapid, split-second CSS "glitch" effect—temporarily skewing the box and randomizing its text characters before stabilizing, simulating a successful decryption.

**Content Windows (Sections 1-6)**

**Window 1: GlglStats**
Design this window to look like an active data-compression terminal. Display a fake, blinking ASCII progress bar (`[████████░░░] 77%`). 
The description should read: `> FETCHING PROJECT: GlglStats. Analyzing Israeli pop-chart repetitiveness via LZ77 compression.`
Present the links as executable commands. 
Link 1: `> Execute payload: glglstats.geekip.dev`
Link 2: `> Intercept video feed: PyData TLV Presentation (youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo)`

**Window 2: Ahuzat Dibuk**
This window should feature a tiny, randomly updating ASCII "heat-map" grid (using characters like `. : % # @`) to represent the Tel-Aviv parking lot occupancy. 
Description: `> NODE ACTIVATED: Ahuzat Dibuk. Scraping Tel-Aviv parking matrices. Visualizing sector occupancy.`
Links should be styled as intercepted news broadcasts:
- `> Decrypt 13tv Signal` (hyperlink to 13tv.co.il item)
- `> Access Mako Mainframe` (hyperlink to mako.co.il item)
- `> Breach Secret Tel-Aviv Comms` (hyperlink to facebook.com/groups/secrettelaviv)

**Window 3: 2D Part Orienting**
Display a geometric, rotating ASCII polygon animation playing in a loop.
Description: `> COMPILING C++ BINARIES: 2D Part Orienting. Initializing open-source computational geometry library. Generating push-plan algorithms.`
Link: `> Download Source_Code & Documentation` (hyperlink to cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting)

**Window 4: The Turing Jest**
Style this window like a rapid-fire chatbot testing arena. Flash the text 'EVALUATING PUN MATRIX' at the top. 
Description: `> INITIATING LMSYS PROTOCOL: The Turing Jest. LLMs locked in arena combat. Objective: Pun generation and explication. Awaiting user telemetry.`
Link: `> Enter Arena Dashboard: jest.geekip.dev`

**Window 5: Rhymes of Israel**
Design an animated "code injection" visual here, representing the Chrome Extension patching the browser. 
Description: `> INJECTING EXTENSION: Rhymes of Israel. Intercepting news site DOMs. LLM processing headlines... Outputting comedic highschool yearbook rhymes.`
Link: `> Install Chrome Extension Payload` (hyperlink to the chromewebstore link).

**Window 6: Meta Portfolio Project**
Make this window look corrupted or stuck in an infinite loop, utilizing rapid text-shadow color shifting between green and warning-red.
Description: `> WARNING: RECURSIVE LOOP DETECTED. Currently rendering the portfolio that renders the portfolio.`
Link: `> Trace Loop: geekip.dev`

**Command Hub (Section 7 - Social Links)**
Position this as a sleek, dedicated communications panel, perhaps spanning the bottom section or anchored as a floating sidebar. Title it `> ESTABLISH EXTERNAL UPLINKS`. 
The links should emulate a network ping interface. When the user hovers over a link, it types out `pinging target... 12ms. Connection established.`
- `> Tgt: GitHub (github.com/gevak)`
- `> Tgt: LinkedIn (linkedin.com/in/gevakip)`
- `> Tgt: Facebook (facebook.com/geva.kipper)`

**System Footer (Credits & Temporal Tracker)**
At the absolute bottom of the screen, fixed to the viewport, create a final command prompt line spanning the width.
On the left side: `> UI_ARCHITECT: Coded and synthesized by DeepSeek AI [System Operational].`
On the right side, implement the stopwatch. Title it `> TEMPORAL DISPLACEMENT SINCE TIMESTAMP [2026-03-02 01:26:37]:`. Ensure the JS utilizes a constant, precise tick update (showing Hours:Minutes:Seconds:Milliseconds) rendered in ultra-bright, electric neon green so that the rapid movement of the milliseconds emphasizes the high-tech, frantic cinematic hacking vibe.
