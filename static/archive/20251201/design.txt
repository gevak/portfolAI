# Portfolio Website Design: Calendar Flip Through Time

## Overall Concept & Visual Theme

The entire page is styled as a giant vintage-meets-modern desk calendar, with a rich cream/off-white textured paper background featuring subtle paper grain. The calendar sits on a dark walnut wood-textured surface that frames the edges of the viewport. A spiral binding runs horizontally across the top of the page, rendered with realistic metallic silver coils and small shadow effects. Each project section appears as a "monthly page" of this calendar, with the characteristic torn perforation edge at the top of each card where it would detach from the spiral.

## Color Palette & Typography

Primary colors: Deep burgundy (#8B1E3F) for accents and dates, warm cream (#FDF6E3) for card backgrounds, charcoal (#2D3436) for body text, and soft gold (#D4AF37) for highlights and hover states. Typography uses a hand-drawn calendar font like "Caveat" or "Architects Daughter" for the month/date headers, paired with a clean sans-serif like "Inter" for body content. The developer name uses an elegant serif font with slight letter-spacing.

## Header Section

At the very top, "GEVA KIPPER" appears as if embossed into the calendar cover in large burgundy letters with a subtle debossed shadow effect. Below, in handwritten-style font: "Software Engineer crafting intelligent systems at Google." Underneath, a small torn-off sticky note (slightly askew, with a soft drop shadow) contains the AI redesign message in pencil-grey italics, with a tiny sparkle animation on the word "AI."

## Project Cards Layout & Animation

Six project boxes are arranged in a 3x2 grid on desktop, each styled as a calendar page showing "1" as the large date number in the corner (representing "first of month"). Each card has a different month name at the top in red calendar typography. When hovering over a card, it performs a 3D flip animation as if turning the calendar page, revealing project links on the "back" while the front curls up. The flip rotation is 15 degrees on the Y-axis with a paper-flutter easing curve.

## Individual Card Designs

**Card 1 - GlglStats (January):** Features a waveform visualization graphic in the background made of repeating musical note patterns that compress/repeat visually to demonstrate the LZ77 concept. A small play button icon styled as a red circle indicates the video link. The PyData logo appears as a small stamp in the corner.

**Card 2 - Ahuzat Dibuk (March):** Displays a miniature heat-map gradient in the card background, transitioning from green to red. Small car icons are scattered decoratively. News outlet logos (Channel 13, Mako) appear as small badges.

**Card 3 - 2D Part Orienting (May):** Features an animated geometric polygon in the background that slowly rotates and "orients" itself. Clean, technical line-art style with blue geometric accent lines.

**Card 4 - The Turing Jest (July):** Comic-style speech bubbles emerge from the corners. A small jester hat icon appears near the title. The background has subtle "ha ha" text patterns in very light grey.

**Card 5 - Rhymes of Israel (September):** Styled like a yearbook page with a graduation cap motif. Rhyming words are connected by dotted curved lines as a decorative element. The Chrome logo appears as a small pin.

**Card 6 - This Portfolio (November):** Contains a recursive illustration—a tiny calendar within the calendar card showing the same layout. An infinity symbol subtly pulses in the corner.

## Social Links Section (December)

Styled as the final calendar page of the year, with "December 31" prominent. GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook icons appear as circular stamps/seals in different colors (black, blue, navy) with a wax-seal texture effect. They gently wobble on hover as if freshly stamped.

## Footer & Stopwatch

The footer appears as the cardboard backing of the calendar. The AI credit is written in typewriter font as if stamped at a factory. The stopwatch is designed as a vintage flip-clock display, with each digit in its own rectangular housing that flips mechanically when updating. The time-since counter shows days, hours, minutes, seconds with soft click animations.

## Micro-interactions & Polish

Cursor changes to a pencil icon when hovering interactive elements. Clicking cards produces a soft paper-rustling sound effect (optional, with mute toggle). The spiral binding casts dynamic shadows as users scroll. Subtle parallax effect makes the wood background move slower than the calendar content.
