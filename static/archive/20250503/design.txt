# Design for Geva Kipper's ASCII Art Portfolio Website

## Overall Theme
A retro terminal-inspired single page website featuring ASCII art with text-based navigation. The site simulates an old-school computer terminal with green text on black background, complete with cursor blinking and typing effects.

## Header
- Large ASCII art rendering of "GEVA KIPPER" in a blocky computer font
- Subtitle in terminal style: "Currently engineering @ Google, making machines think and data talk"
- Animated subtitle that types out: "This website is re-designed daily by AI and is ever-changing" with a blinking cursor at the end

## Navigation
- Text-based menu that appears as command options: [1] Projects [2] Contact [3] Toggle ASCII Mode
- When clicking on a navigation option, the screen simulates a terminal command being entered
- Navigation is fixed to the top, looking like a command line interface

## Projects Section
Five terminal-style windows arranged in a grid (responsive to screen size):

1. **GlglStats Terminal**
   - ASCII art visualization of sound waves
   - Terminal-style header: "$ run GlglStats.py"
   - Description in monospace font with syntax highlighting for code elements
   - Terminal-style links: "$ open presentation.vid" and "$ visit website"
   - When hovering, an ASCII animation suggests data being processed

2. **Ahuzat Dibuk Terminal**
   - ASCII art map of Tel-Aviv with heat map elements
   - Terminal header: "$ python scrape_parking.py"
   - Description showing as command output with loading bars
   - Media links formatted as "$ cat news_article_1.txt", "$ cat news_article_2.txt"
   - Original publication link as "$ open original_post.fb"

3. **2D Part Orienting Terminal**
   - ASCII representation of polygon manipulation
   - Terminal header: "$ make && ./orient_part"
   - Technical description formatted as C++ code comments
   - Link to project as "$ git clone geometry_lib"
   - Animation showing a simple polygon being oriented when hovered

4. **Meta Portfolio Terminal**
   - Recursive ASCII art showing a terminal within a terminal
   - Terminal header: "$ ssh portfolio.server"
   - Self-referential description with inception jokes
   - Link styled as "$ ping portfolio-dor1.onrender.com"
   - Animated infinite loop effect when hovered

5. **Contact Terminal**
   - ASCII art avatar of Geva
   - Terminal header: "$ whoami && find contact"
   - Social links formatted as Unix commands:
     - "$ git clone github.com/gevak"
     - "$ connect linkedin.com/in/gevakip"
     - "$ poke facebook.com/geva.kipper"
   - Links glow when hovered over

## Interactive Elements
- Cursor follows mouse as a blinking terminal cursor
- Clicking anywhere produces a keystroke sound and small terminal command line at cursor position
- Typing actual commands reveals easter eggs (like "help", "ls", "cat cv.txt")
- Terminal-style loading animations between section transitions

## Footer
- Terminal prompt showing: "Created by [AI Model Name] on [current date]"
- Running stopwatch displaying time since 2025-05-03 01:02:59 in format "Uptime: XXh XXm XXs"
- ASCII art horizontal rule separator
- The footer appears to be executing a "keep-alive" ping command with regular dots appearing

## Responsive Design
- On mobile, the terminal windows stack vertically
- A "mobile mode" toggle appears that simplifies the ASCII art for smaller screens
- Touch events generate "tap" indicators that look like command input

## Special Effects
- Occasional "glitch" effects that momentarily distort the screen
- Random terminal messages appear at the bottom like system notifications
- Option to toggle between green-on-black and amber-on-black color schemes
- Easter egg: Konami code input triggers a "sudo mode" with enhanced ASCII animations
