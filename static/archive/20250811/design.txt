The website opens to what looks like a **retro-futuristic desktop environment**, filling the browser window. The background is a deep, subtle animated gradient that shifts slowly over time — colors morph in smooth transitions like an active AI-generated wallpaper. Across the top is a **thin OS-like taskbar** with a small start button (showing a pixel-art AI icon), the developer’s name in a neat system font, “**Geva Kipper** — Software Engineer at Google, working on cutting-edge AI algorithms,” and a **real-time digital clock** in the far right corner. Just below the name, in smaller italic text: “*This site is re-designed daily by AI — it’s never the same twice.*”  

The main “desktop” area contains **seven large draggable folder icons** scattered playfully across the space, styled like a hybrid between vintage Mac OS icons and modern neumorphism. Each folder folder has its name tucked beneath it and a subtle hover animation where it lifts slightly and glows. Double-clicking (or tapping) a folder opens up a **floating, resizable “window”** in the middle of the screen, with a retro title bar and close/minimize buttons. These popups are semi-transparent with soft glassmorphism blur, but contain modern, elegant typography inside.  

Inside each window:  

1. **GlglStats** – Folder opens to a split-pane view. Left: a short description. Right: a large video thumbnail (frame from the PyData TLV talk) with a play button linking to YouTube. Below the video, a glowing “Visit the Project” button linking to *https://glglstats.geekip.dev*.  
   
2. **Ahuzat Dibuk** – Folder window shows the description text in a “command prompt” style panel scrolling into view, as if loaded by a script. Below, three clickable buttons: “21 News Article,” “Mako News Article,” and “Original Facebook Post” — styled as colorful glass buttons.  

3. **2D Part Orienting** – A crisp technical-style card inside the window with a black-on-white schematic of polygon push orientation, code snippet in syntax-colored monospaced font below, and a neat external link button.  

4. **The Turing Jest** – A playful theme inside the window: yellow header bar and chat-bubble styled text describing the LLM pun competition, with a big blue “Go to Arena” button.  

5. **Rhymes of Israel** – Window background lightly patterned with rhyming couplet text in faded lines. Centered: Chrome extension badge with a “Install on Chrome” link.  

6. **This Site** – A fully meta entry: screenshot of the site’s current desktop layout (captured in real-time), description in a simple paragraph, link to *https://geekip.dev*.  

7. **Social Links** – Instead of text, this folder window resembles a retro “Control Panel” with large minimalistic icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook that animate when hovered over.  

The bottom taskbar also slowly fills with “window tabs” when folders are opened, allowing users to reopen or close them. A “trash bin” icon lurks in the bottom right for fun.  

At the very bottom, spanning the full width under the “desktop”, in tiny but clear text on a semi-transparent strip: “Designed today by ChatGPT, AI Model vX.YZ” — next to it, a constantly running **stopwatch counter** in hours:minutes:seconds since **2025-08-11 01:16:01**, styled like a system uptime indicator.  

The site’s atmosphere feels **nostalgic yet futuristic**, with hints of humor, interactivity that mimics an operable OS, and just enough modern polish to make the experience smooth on desktop and mobile.

Do you want me to also **draft the exact layout mockup** for the designer with positioning of each folder, window, and UI element? That would make this “Virtual OS Portfolio” instantly actionable.
