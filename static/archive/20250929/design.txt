### **Website Design: The Git Career Timeline**

**Overall Concept:**

The website is a single, scrollable page that visualizes a career path as a Git repository's branching history. The background is a dark, textured charcoal grey, reminiscent of a code editor's dark mode. A central, vertical timeline, representing the `main` branch, runs down the middle of the screen. As the user scrolls, this line animates, drawing itself downwards. Projects are represented as feature branches that split off from this main line, culminating in a "commit" node. The entire experience is fluid, animated, and interactive.

**Header Section (The Initial Commit):**

Upon loading, the top of the page is clean and focused. In the center, the name "**Geva Kipper**" is displayed in a bold, modern sans-serif font with a subtle, soft white glow. Directly beneath it, in a slightly smaller, crisp font, is the sentence: "Software Engineer at Google, building the next generation of search experiences."

Below this, a small, vibrant, multi-colored subtitle reads: "This site is programmatically re-designed by an AI each day, making it a perpetually evolving digital canvas." This subtitle has a gentle "breathing" animation, subtly shifting its colors over time. From the bottom of this text block, the `main` branch line begins, a solid light-grey line, prompting the user to scroll down to explore the history.

**Main Body (The Branching History):**

As the user scrolls, the `main` branch line extends downwards. At specific scroll points, a new colored line (a feature branch) will elegantly animate, splitting off from the `main` branch and curving towards the left or right side of the screen. Each branch has its own unique, bright color (e.g., electric blue, neon green, vibrant orange). At the end of each branch is a circular "commit" node that pulses gently.

Hovering over a commit node causes it to glow brightly and reveals a tooltip with a Git-style commit message, like `feat: GlglStats` or `fix: Tel-Aviv parking crisis`.

Clicking on a commit node triggers the main interaction: the branch and node light up, and the corresponding project box elegantly fades and scales into view next to it. If another project box is already open, it gracefully fades out. The layout alternates, with the first project appearing on the left, the second on the right, and so on, creating a balanced visual flow.

**The Project Boxes (The Commits):**

Each project box has a semi-transparent, blurred-glass background, allowing the Git branch visualization behind it to remain partially visible. The text is clean white.

1.  **GlglStats:**
    *   **Title:** `feat: GlglStats` in a monospaced font.
    *   **Description:** A Python project measuring the repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression and visualizing repetition patterns.
    *   **Links:** Presented as minimalist icons with text labels: a chain-link icon for "Project Site," a YouTube icon for "PyData Talk."

2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk:**
    *   **Title:** `fix: Ahuzat Dibuk`
    *   **Description:** A Python data-viz project scraping and mapping Tel-Aviv parking lot occupancy, creating heat-maps for residents.
    *   **Links:** A newspaper icon for "13TV News," another for "Mako News," and a Facebook icon for "Original Post."

3.  **2D Part Orienting:**
    *   **Title:** `feat: 2D Part Orienting`
    *   **Description:** An efficient C++ algorithm, contributed to a CGAL library, for constructing a 'push plan' to orient a polygon.
    *   **Links:** A code (`</>`) icon for "Info & Source Code."

4.  **The Turing Jest:**
    *   **Title:** `feat: The Turing Jest`
    *   **Description:** An LMSYS-style arena where LLMs compete at making puns, with user-based rating and explanations.
    *   **Links:** A chain-link icon for "Try The Arena."

5.  **Rhymes of Israel:**
    *   **Title:** `feat: Rhymes of Israel`
    *   **Description:** A Chrome extension that uses an LLM to rewrite Israeli news headlines into comedic, highschool-yearbook-style rhymes.
    *   **Links:** A puzzle-piece (extension) icon for "Install Extension."

6.  **Portfolio.dev (Meta Project):**
    *   This branch is a special, shimmering rainbow color.
    *   **Title:** `chore: The Git Timeline`
    *   **Description:** A self-referential project. This very website, designed to visualize a career as an ever-changing, AI-generated Git history.
    *   **Links:** A recursion icon for "View Source (You are here)."

**Final Section (Contact & Repo Info):**

After the last project branch, the `main` timeline terminates in a final, solid node. Below this, aligned to the center, is a section titled `.config` in a monospaced font. This section contains three large, stylized icons for **GitHub**, **LinkedIn**, and **Facebook**. Hovering over an icon causes it to scale up slightly and display Geva's username for that platform. Clicking takes the user to the respective profile.

**Footer (The AI Signature):**

At the very bottom of the page, centered and in a small, understated font, is the footer.

First line: "This daily design iteration was generated by a GPT-4-class Large Language Model."
Second line: A real-time stopwatch, labeled "Time Since Last Manual Push:" dynamically counting up (in HH:MM:SS format) from the timestamp `2025-09-29 01:04:21`. This adds a quirky, futuristic, and "live" element to the AI theme.
