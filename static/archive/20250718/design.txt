### Website Design: The Ever-Changing Comic

**Overall Concept:**

The website is a single, vertically scrolling page designed as a high-quality, modern digital comic book. The aesthetic is clean and elegant, using a dark-mode theme with a limited but vibrant color palette (e.g., deep charcoal grey, off-white, and a single, striking accent color like electric blue or cyberpunk magenta). The layout is dynamic, with panels arranged in an engaging, non-uniform grid that guides the user's eye down the page. The typography consists of a bold, stylized font for headlines (reminiscent of comic titles) and a clean, highly readable sans-serif for body text. All interactive elements have subtle, polished animations.

**Header Section (The "Cover Page"):**

The top of the page serves as the comic's cover. It features a large, stylized title: **GEVA KIPPER**. Beneath the name, a stylized illustration of Geva is depicted as a comic book character, perhaps seated at a futuristic console with lines of code shimmering around him. To the right of the illustration, a prominent caption box contains a single sentence: "A Software Engineer at Google, crafting the future of information access."

Directly below this, a sub-header is rendered in a different, slightly mechanical font, as if stamped onto the page: `This portfolio is algorithmically re-designed each day by an AI. The layout, color scheme, and illustrations you see are unique to today.`

**Project Panels:**

The user scrolls down through the "pages" of the comic. The six project boxes and the final contact section are presented as seven distinct comic panels. These panels are not simple rectangles but are arranged dynamically with varying sizes and tilted angles, separated by thin "gutters" of the background. On scroll, each panel animates into view with a subtle fade and slide effect.

1.  **Panel 1: GlglStats**
    *   **Visual:** A central illustration of a soundwave transforming into an LZ77 compression graph, with musical notes floating around it.
    *   **Title:** "GlglStats: The Repetitiveness of Pop" in a bold headline.
    *   **Description:** A caption box at the bottom reads: "A Python project measuring the repetitiveness of Israeli pop songs using LZ77 compression, with visualizations of famous repetition patterns."
    *   **Links:** Two buttons designed like action sound effects in a comic (e.g., in a starburst shape). The first says "SEE THE STATS" (links to the site) and the second says "WATCH THE TALK" (links to the YouTube video).

2.  **Panel 2: Ahuzat Dibuk**
    *   **Visual:** A stylized, top-down map of Tel-Aviv, glowing with a heatmap effect. Cars are represented as simple icons, some faded, some bright.
    *   **Title:** "Ahuzat Dibuk: The Parking Hunter"
    *   **Description:** "A data scraping and visualization project that generates heatmaps of Tel-Aviv parking lot occupancy to help residents find a spot."
    *   **Links:** Three small, clean icons: two "Newspaper" icons for the news stories and a "Facebook" icon for the original post. Hovering over them reveals the source (13tv, Mako, Secret Tel Aviv).

3.  **Panel 3: 2D Part Orienting**
    *   **Visual:** A blueprint-style illustration showing a complex polygon being nudged by abstract "pusher" lines, with geometric vectors and angles annotated around it.
    *   **Title:** "2D Part Orienting: The Geometry of Order"
    *   **Description:** "A C++ implementation of an efficient algorithm for constructing a 'push plan' to orient a given polygon, contributed to an open-source computational geometry library."
    *   **Link:** A single, clean button that says "VIEW THE ALGORITHM & CODE" (links to the project page).

4.  **Panel 4: The Turing Jest**
    *   **Visual:** Two stylized robots facing each other on a stage, with speech bubbles containing a question mark and a lightbulb. User rating stars (1-5) float between them.
    *   **Title:** "The Turing Jest: Can a Machine be Punny?"
    *   **Description:** "An LLM arena where AI models compete to generate and explain puns. Humans vote on who told the better joke."
    *   **Link:** A button with a glowing border that says "JUDGE THE JESTS" (links to the site).

5.  **Panel 5: Rhymes of Israel**
    *   **Visual:** An illustration of a newspaper where the headlines are peeling off to reveal rhyming, handwritten-style text underneath. A small Chrome logo is subtly integrated.
    *   **Title:** "Rhymes of Israel: The Poetic News"
    *   **Description:** "A Chrome extension that uses an LLM to rewrite Israeli news headlines into comedic, highschool-yearbook-style rhymes."
    *   **Link:** A button that mimics the Chrome Web Store's "Add to Chrome" button, reading "INSTALL THE RHYMES".

6.  **Panel 6: The Portfolio Project (Meta Panel)**
    *   **Visual:** An illustration of a hand drawing the very comic book panel the user is looking at, creating an infinite loop effect.
    *   **Title:** "The Comic Portfolio: You Are Here"
    *   **Description:** "This ever-changing, AI-designed portfolio. A single-page application built with modern web technologies, designed to be as creative as the projects it contains."
    *   **Link:** A link stylized as a simple, underlined signature: "geekip.dev".

**Final Panel & Footer:**

7.  **Panel 7 (The "Credits Scene"):**
    *   This is the final, bottom-most panel. Itâ€™s a simple, wide panel designed to look like the publisher's information block at the end of a comic. It contains three large, clean icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook, which glow with the site's accent color on hover. The links are embedded in the icons.

**Footer:**

Below all the panels, separated by a clean line, is the footer. It is outside the "comic" itself.

*   On the left, a single line of text in a small, monospace font: `Designed by [Your AI Model Name].`
*   On the right, a live, ticking stopwatch with a label: `Time since last universal refresh:`. The clock displays a real-time count of hours, minutes, and seconds passed since `2025-07-18 01:12:13`. This element is dynamic and reinforces the "ever-changing" theme.
