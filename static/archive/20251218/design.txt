Design the page as a full-screen **retro arcade cabinet** that sits centered on a dark “arcade floor” background. The background subtly animates with slow-moving scanlines, faint CRT glow, and occasional reflected neon streaks, but stays understated and elegant (deep charcoal, muted magenta/cyan highlights). The cabinet itself is the entire single-page layout: a beveled frame with tasteful pixel-art accents, a “marquee” at the top, a large “CRT screen” area in the middle (main content), and a slim “control panel” area near the bottom for navigation/mini-games. Typography mixes a modern sans for body text with a restrained pixel-style font used only for headings and UI labels, so it feels retro without becoming kitschy.

At the very top, the **marquee** reads: **“GEVA KIPPER”** in a crisp neon sign style. Directly beneath, inside the cabinet’s header area, place one clear sentence about his current role at Google (e.g., “Geva Kipper is a software engineer at Google, currently working on large-scale systems.”). Under that, add a smaller subtitle in a slightly italic “system message” style: **“This portfolio is re-designed each day by AI — it’s an ever-changing cabinet.”** Include a tiny “DAILY BUILD” indicator light to the right that softly pulses, reinforcing the idea that the layout is regenerated.

The main “CRT screen” region is a single-page, scrollable canvas that behaves like a **game selection screen**. Instead of a normal grid, present the projects as **interactive arcade “cartridges” / “tiles”** that look like pixelated game posters floating in a tidy 2-column layout (collapsing to 1 column on mobile). Each tile is a “mini-game attract mode”: idle animation (a looping 2–3 second micro-scene) plus a “PRESS START” callout. On hover/tap, the tile flips or slides to reveal the project details with a clean modern card interior (sharp spacing, readable text, minimal clutter). Clicking “START” opens an in-place overlay panel inside the CRT (not a new page) with the project summary, links, and (where relevant) embedded media, then returns you to the selection screen with a “Back to Arcade” button.

Use **seven tiles/boxes** (six project tiles + one social tile), each styled as a distinct “game genre” while remaining cohesive (same card shape, consistent margins, shared glow effects). Each tile has: a bold title, one-line tagline, and “buttons” for links (styled like arcade buttons: rounded, glossy, but tasteful). Add a small “HIGH SCORE” style stat line per tile that humorously maps to the project (e.g., “DATA POINTS COLLECTED,” “PUNS RATED,” “POLYGONS ORIENTED”)—not real numbers, just a flavorful label that can later be filled in.

**Tile 1 — “GlglStats” (Python):** Style as a rhythm-game poster (equalizer bars, subtle waveform, and pixel music notes). When opened, show: “Python project measuring repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression; visualizes repetition patterns across famous songs.” Include two prominent link-buttons: **Visit: https://glglstats.geekip.dev** and **Watch PyData TLV talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo**. The overlay includes an embedded YouTube player framed like a tiny CRT-in-CRT window, with a faint vignette.

**Tile 2 — “Ahuzat Dibuk” (Python scraping + viz):** Style as a city-map strategy game tile: a minimalist pixel grid of Tel Aviv with pulsing heat spots. In the overlay, describe it as “scraping and visualizing Tel-Aviv parking-lot occupancy, generating resident-friendly heat maps.” Present three “News / Source” buttons in a neat row or column:  
- https://13tv.co.il/item/news/domestic/internal/parking-902956407/  
- https://www.mako.co.il/nexter-news/Article-ae43964b891bf71027.htm  
- https://www.facebook.com/groups/secrettelaviv/posts/10159636301195943/  
Add a small “RADAR SCAN” animation behind the text at very low opacity.

**Tile 3 — “2D Part Orienting” (C++ computational geometry):** Style as a precision puzzle/engineering game. The tile shows a rotating polygon outline with a “push vector” arrow. The overlay explains: “C++ implementation in an open-source computational geometry library of an efficient algorithm constructing a push plan to orient a given polygon.” Include a clear “Docs & Code” button: **https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/**. Keep this one sleek and technical—less neon, more blueprint cyan on dark.

**Tile 4 — “The Turing Jest” (LLM pun arena):** Style as a versus fighting-game character select screen: two silhouetted “bots” facing off with a marquee that flickers “PUN BATTLE.” In the overlay: “An LMSYS-like arena where LLMs compete at making and explaining puns; users rate the answers.” Add one main button: **https://jest.geekip.dev**. Include a tiny in-overlay “Audience Applause Meter” bar that animates subtly.

**Tile 5 — “Rhymes of Israel” (Chrome extension):** Style as a comedy word-game tile, like a retro “typewriter meets headline ticker.” In the overlay: “Chrome extension that uses an LLM to rewrite Israeli news headlines into comedic rhymes in a high-school yearbook style.” Add an install button: **https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eainginjgdkpgolpjniijdihfbeeeklb**. Include a short animated sample headline transforming into a rhyming version (purely illustrative text motion, no heavy content).

**Tile 6 — “Portfolio (Meta)” (this site):** Style as an “endless mode” game. The tile shows a looping “LEVEL UP / RE-SKINNING” animation with a tiny AI chip icon. In the overlay, present it as: “A portfolio website project (how meta!) — a single-page arcade cabinet that regenerates daily.” Add a self-reference button: **https://geekip.dev**. Include a “Today’s Skin” label with a small color swatch strip to emphasize daily redesign.

**Tile 7 — “Social / Player Profile”:** Make this feel like an arcade “player card” with a pixel avatar placeholder silhouette and “PLAYER: GEVAKIP” style text. Include three large, clean icon-buttons with labels (not only icons):  
- GitHub: **github.com/gevak**  
- LinkedIn: **linkedin.com/in/gevakip**  
- Facebook: **facebook.com/geva.kipper**  
Add a “INSERT COIN” micro-interaction on hover that simply brightens the buttons (no gimmicky popups).

Navigation is integrated into the cabinet’s **control panel** at the bottom: a horizontal row of “arcade buttons” that scroll/jump to each tile (GlglStats, Ahuzat Dibuk, 2D Part Orienting, The Turing Jest, Rhymes of Israel, Portfolio, Social). To keep it elegant, use minimal labels and a small LED indicator dot that tracks the currently centered tile while scrolling. Add a thin, tasteful “progress bezel” along the cabinet edge that fills as the user scrolls down the single page.

The footer sits beneath the cabinet or as a slim strip within the bottom bezel. It contains two elements: (1) a credit line in a small, understated monospace: **“Created by the AI model (ChatGPT) on 2025-12-18.”** (or equivalent credit phrasing), and (2) a **stopwatch** styled like an arcade timer display (7-segment digits) labeled “TIME SINCE 2025-12-18 01:07:42” that continuously counts **hours : minutes : seconds**. Keep the timer visually satisfying but not distracting—small glow, stable brightness, and positioned bottom-right to feel like a cabinet status readout.

Overall feel: modern, clean spacing and readability first, with retro arcade personality expressed through restrained CRT effects, neon accents, and playful “mini-game” interactions that turn each project into something you “play” to learn, without ever leaving the single-page cabinet.
