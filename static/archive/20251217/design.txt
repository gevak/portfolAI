Design the site as a single-page “Bug Tracker Diary” UI—an elegant, dark-themed issue tracker that feels like a personal engineering logbook. The whole page reads like one continuously scrolling backlog, but with a subtle “diary” tone: each project is an “issue” that was opened, investigated, and resolved (or intentionally left “open” as an ongoing experiment). Use a refined mono + sans pairing (e.g., a clean grotesk for headings and a developer-mono for metadata), with ample whitespace, thin dividers, and calm accent colors (soft teal for links, amber for “in progress,” violet for “AI rewrite” tags). Introduce gentle micro-interactions: hover reveals, expanding “issue details,” and a floating “command palette” hint (purely visual) to sell the tracker vibe without adding complexity.

At the top: a sticky header bar styled like a tracker’s project header. Left: “Geva Kipper” as the repo/board name. Below it, a single sentence describing his current work at Google (displayed like a pinned announcement banner in a tracker, e.g., “Currently building software at Google.”). Immediately under that, a subtitle banner with a distinctive “AI-generated daily redesign” treatment: “Redesigned each day by AI—ever-changing.” Make this look like an automated system note with a small “bot” icon and a timestamp chip (“Daily rebuild”), plus a subtle animated shimmer on the subtitle text to imply ongoing change. Add a thin horizontal timeline under the header that looks like an activity graph, but it’s purely decorative—just enough to reinforce the “tracker diary” theme.

Main content: a single vertical list of issue cards, each card looking like a premium tracker issue with a status pill, issue number, labels, short summary, and a collapsible details area. Each “box/section” is one issue card; keep all cards consistent but let each have one unique visual clue (an icon, label color, or tiny inline chart) that matches the project. Each card header includes: issue key (e.g., “GEVA-001”), title, a one-line “diary entry” summary, and labels like `python`, `viz`, `scraping`, `geometry`, `llm`, `chrome-extension`, `meta`. On click (or a visible “Expand” chevron), the card opens to reveal: a short story paragraph (written as a bug diary: what problem was observed, what investigation happened, what outcome shipped), key tech stack badges, and the required links rendered as “attachments” (tracker-style) with file-like rows (link icon, name, small description, and an external-link indicator). Use tasteful, minimal icons and avoid clutter.

Issue 1 card: **“GlglStats”** presented as a closed issue with a “Release” tag. The expanded area includes a compact, decorative “compression stripes” mini-visual (thin horizontal bars suggesting LZ77 patterns) next to the text. Include the site link as an attachment row: `glglstats.geekip.dev` and a second attachment row for the PyData TLV talk video: `youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo`, styled like a recorded demo asset (with a tiny play icon). The text should explicitly mention: Python project measuring repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs via LZ77 compression and visualizing repetition patterns in famous songs.

Issue 2 card: **“Ahuzat Dibuk”** as a high-impact “Incident” style entry with a `data` and `civic` label. The expanded detail area includes a heatmap-themed accent (a soft gradient corner highlight reminiscent of a map heat layer). Provide three attachment rows: the two news stories (13tv + mako) and the original Facebook post, each labeled like “Press coverage” and “Original publication.” The diary story should mention: Python scraping + data visualization collecting Tel-Aviv parking lot occupancy stats and generating resident-friendly heat maps.

Issue 3 card: **“2D Part Orienting”** as a “Performance” or “Algorithm” issue. Add a geometric accent: a faint wireframe polygon watermark or a minimal line drawing of a pushed polygon in the corner of the card. The details area includes the link to additional info and code as a single attachment row: `cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/`. The description should highlight: C++ implementation in an open-source computational geometry library; efficient algorithm constructing a push plan to orient a polygon.

Issue 4 card: **“The Turing Jest”** as an “Experiment” issue with `llm-arena` and `humor` labels. Use a playful but still elegant twist: the status pill could be “LIVE” with a subtle pulsing outline, and the card includes a tiny “arena bracket” decorative glyph. In details, include the site link attachment: `jest.geekip.dev`. The story should mention: LMSYS-like arena where LLMs compete at making/explaining puns; users rate answers.

Issue 5 card: **“Rhymes of Israel”** as a “Shipping” issue with `chrome-extension` and `llm` labels. Give it a typographic flourish: the expanded area shows one short, stylized example line area (not necessarily a real headline, just a placeholder) formatted like a yearbook caption—framed, slightly tilted, but still restrained. Include the Chrome Web Store install link attachment: `chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eainginjgdkpgolpjniijdihfbeeeklb`. The story should mention: Chrome extension rewriting Israeli news headlines into comedic rhymes in the style of a high school yearbook.

Issue 6 card: **“Portfolio Website (Meta)”** as a self-referential “Refactor” issue with a `meta` label and a “Recursive” tag. Make this card slightly special: when expanded, it reveals a “self-link” attachment to `geekip.dev` and a subtle “infinite loop” decorative line motif. The copy should explicitly call out: presenting a portfolio website project (how meta).

Final box/section (Issue 7) is a “Contact / Profiles” issue, styled like an “Open” ticket awaiting collaboration. Keep it clean and high trust: three prominent attachment rows with platform icons and the exact links: `github.com/gevak`, `linkedin.com/in/gevakip`, `facebook.com/geva.kipper`. Add a small “Preferred channel” hint visually (e.g., a tiny star next to LinkedIn), but keep it optional and minimal.

At the bottom, include a tracker-like footer bar with two elements. Left: credit line in small, muted text: “Created by the AI model (ChatGPT) on 2025-12-17” (or equivalent), styled like an automated system comment. Right: a bold “Stopwatch since 2025-12-17 01:06:19” display that updates in-place (HH:MM:SS), designed like a running build timer chip with a subtle blinking separator. The stopwatch should feel like a CI pipeline duration readout—clean, precise, and always moving—closing the page with the sense that the diary (and the AI redesign) is continuously in progress.
