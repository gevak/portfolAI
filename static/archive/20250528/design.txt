The website opens with a dark terminal-like background (#1a1a1a) featuring a full-screen code editor interface. At the top, "Geva Kipper" appears as a highlighted function name in bright cyan, followed by a comment line explaining his current work at Google in muted green text. Below that, an italic subtitle in grey explains the AI-redesigned nature of the site.

The main content area resembles a sophisticated IDE with syntax highlighting. Five distinct "code blocks" serve as project sections, each styled as different programming constructs - functions, classes, and objects. The GlglStats project appears as a Python function definition with proper indentation, featuring the project description in docstring format and interactive buttons styled as method calls for the website link and YouTube video.

The Ahuzat Dibuk section renders as a data visualization class with attributes representing the project details. News links appear as imported modules at the top of the class definition. The 2D Part Orienting project displays as a C++ namespace with templated functions, maintaining authentic syntax highlighting in blue and purple tones.

The portfolio meta-project appears as a recursive function that calls itself, creating a playful visual loop effect. The contact section renders as a JSON object with social media links as key-value pairs, complete with proper bracket formatting and comma separations.

At the bottom right corner, a small "compiled by" comment credits the AI, while a live stopwatch in monospace font displays elapsed time since the specified date, updating every second. The entire interface includes subtle line numbers on the left margin and uses the Fira Code font family to maintain authentic coding aesthetics. Hover effects on interactive elements subtly change the syntax highlighting colors, and clicking links triggers smooth transitions that mimic code execution.
