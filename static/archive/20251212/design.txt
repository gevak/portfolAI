# Auction House Portfolio Design: "Kipper's Code Auction"

## Overall Aesthetic & Atmosphere

The website emulates a prestigious evening auction at a grand auction house—think Sotheby's meets Silicon Valley. The color palette is rich and dramatic: deep burgundy (#4A0E0E), aged gold (#C9A227), cream parchment (#F5F0E6), and black walnut (#2C1810). Typography combines an elegant serif for headings (Playfair Display) with a refined sans-serif for body text (Cormorant Garamond). The background features a subtle texture of aged linen canvas with gentle vignetting at the edges, creating depth.

## Header Section

At the top, an ornate gilded frame (CSS border with corner flourishes) contains the name "GEVA KIPPER" in large, gold-embossed lettering with a subtle drop shadow suggesting depth. Below, in smaller italicized text: "Senior Software Engineer at Google, crafting tools that shape how developers build." Beneath this, a wax seal stamp graphic contains the subtitle in cursive: "This gallery is reimagined daily by artificial intelligence—no two viewings are alike." A small animated flicker effect makes the text appear as if viewed under candlelight.

## Main Auction Gallery

The six project sections are arranged as auction "lots" displayed on wooden easels. On desktop, they form a 3x2 grid; on mobile, they stack vertically. Each easel is a CSS-rendered wooden A-frame with a canvas sitting atop it, slightly tilted as if displayed in a gallery.

### Lot #1: GlglStats
The canvas shows a visualization mockup—circular rings representing song compression patterns in gold lines on dark background. A brass placard below reads "LOT 001 | GlglStats | Est. 2023" with the subtitle "Measuring the mathematical soul of Israeli pop through LZ77 compression." A red "SOLD" ribbon diagonally crosses the corner. Below the easel, two small brass buttons styled as vintage auction paddles link to the website and PyData conference video respectively. Hovering causes the easel to rock gently.

### Lot #2: Ahuzat Dibuk
This canvas displays an abstract heat-map of Tel Aviv in gradient oranges and reds, with iconic parking meter silhouettes. The placard reads "LOT 002 | Ahuzat Dibuk | Parking Intelligence." Three small newspaper clipping graphics (slightly yellowed, torn edges) fan out below linking to the press coverage and Facebook post. A small "Featured in Press" medallion adorns the corner.

### Lot #3: 2D Part Orienting
The canvas shows geometric line art—a polygon being pushed by abstract arrows into orientation, rendered in blueprint style (white lines on deep blue). The placard reads "LOT 003 | 2D Part Orienting | Computational Geometry." A small "Open Source" wax seal in green adorns this lot. A single brass button links to the TAU project page.

### Lot #4: The Turing Jest
This canvas is styled as a comedy club stage spotlight illuminating two robot silhouettes at microphones (suggesting LLM comedy competition). Gold sparkles animate occasionally. The placard reads "LOT 004 | The Turing Jest | Where Machines Learn Mirth." A laughing theater mask icon accompanies the link button.

### Lot #5: Rhymes of Israel
The canvas resembles a vintage Israeli newspaper front page, but the headlines are whimsically typeset in rhyming couplet format with decorative flourishes. A Chrome logo-styled quill pen sits in the corner. The placard reads "LOT 005 | Rhymes of Israel | Headlines Reborn in Verse." Link button styled as a Chrome extension icon.

### Lot #6: This Very Auction
The canvas is a miniature recursive rendering of the entire auction house website (a screenshot of the design itself, creating infinite regression). A gilt frame within the frame. The placard reads "LOT 006 | The Portfolio Itself | A Meta-Masterpiece." Hovering triggers a subtle zoom effect suggesting infinite depth. The self-referential link button reads "View Full Scale."

## Contact Pedestal

Below the lots, a marble pedestal (gradient-rendered) displays three antique golden hand bells. Each bell is engraved with a platform icon: GitHub's octocat, LinkedIn's "in" logo, and Facebook's "f"—all styled as wax seal impressions. Hovering each bell triggers a subtle ring animation and chime sound (optional). Text above reads "Ring to Inquire" in calligraphic script.

## Footer Auction House Plaque

At the very bottom, a brass plaque mounted on dark wood reads: "This auction catalog was curated and designed by Claude, Anthropic's AI Assistant" in engraved lettering. Below it, an antique-styled flip clock (Solari board aesthetic) with brass housing displays the running time since December 12, 2025, 01:10:25—hours, minutes, and seconds flipping mechanically with satisfying animations. Small text beneath: "Time Since Gallery Opening."
