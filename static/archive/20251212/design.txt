Design the page as a “Museum of Software Artifacts” exhibition: a single scrolling hall on a warm, off‑white paper background with subtle fiber texture, as if printed exhibition cards were pinned to a wall. The top of the page feels like the entrance placard of a gallery—centered but not rigid—using an elegant serif for headings (museum label vibe) paired with a crisp modern sans-serif for body text. The hero block reads like a curator’s introduction: **Geva Kipper** as the main title, followed immediately by a single sentence about his current work at Google (styled as a “Curator’s note” line under the name). Beneath that, a smaller subtitle in italic (or small caps) states: “This portfolio is re-designed each day by AI, so the exhibit is ever-changing.” Add a faint “Today’s Exhibit Layout” stamp in the corner with the current date to reinforce the daily regeneration theme.

The core interaction is six (plus one) artifact labels laid out as exhibit cards, each card resembling a real museum label: a top-left accession number, a title, a material/medium line, year/status, and a short curator description. Each card has a thin keyline border, gentle shadow, and tiny “pin” or “tape” detail as if mounted. On hover, the card subtly lifts and reveals a secondary layer: “Provenance / Links,” displayed like a folded corner or slide-out tag. Between cards, use fine dotted “gallery guide” lines and small directional arrows, giving the sense of a curated walking route through the exhibit. Keep the layout responsive: on desktop, use a 2–3 column grid with asymmetric sizing (some cards wider/taller like featured exhibits); on mobile, stack into a single column with generous breathing room.

Each artifact section gets a unique visual motif—like a small icon etched in a single color—while maintaining a consistent museum aesthetic. Place a small “specimen thumbnail” area on each card: not a typical screenshot, but a stylized miniature (e.g., waveform-like patterning, heat-map swatch, polygon outline) that hints at the project. Give each card a short “Interpretive label” paragraph (2–4 lines) that reads like museum text: what it is, why it matters, and what visitors should notice. Links should appear as “View Artifact,” “Read Field Notes,” or “Watch Lecture,” styled like small plaque buttons or underlined catalog references.

**Artifact cards (content and structure):**  
1) **GlglStats** — Label emphasizes it as a Python “analysis instrument.” The specimen thumbnail is a band of repeating blocks suggesting compression patterns. Include: a direct link to **https://glglstats.geekip.dev** and a “Recorded Talk” link to **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo**. Embed the video as a recessed “display screen” within the card when expanded (like a museum AV station), while keeping the default collapsed state clean.  
2) **Ahuzat Dibuk** — Present as a “field survey + cartographic visualization.” Thumbnail uses a small heat-map swatch over a simplified Tel Aviv grid. Include three link chips grouped under “Press Clippings” and “Original Posting”: **https://13tv.co.il/item/news/domestic/internal/parking-902956407/**, **https://www.mako.co.il/nexter-news/Article-ae43964b891bf71027.htm**, and **https://www.facebook.com/groups/secrettelaviv/posts/10159636301195943/**.  
3) **2D Part Orienting** — Present as a “mechanism” exhibit: precise line art of a polygon and a push direction arrow. The label feels more technical, like an engineering wing of the museum. Include “Additional info and code” as a single prominent reference link: **https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/**.  
4) **The Turing Jest** — Present as an “interactive performance piece.” Thumbnail is a speech-bubble duet or a playful typographic knot, still in restrained museum style. Include the site link: **https://jest.geekip.dev**. When expanded, show a short “Audience participation encouraged” note like an exhibit instruction.  
5) **Rhymes of Israel** — Present as a “media intervention artifact.” Thumbnail resembles a clipped newspaper headline strip that morphs into rhyming text lines. Include the Chrome Web Store installation link: **https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eainginjgdkpgolpjniijdihfbeeeklb**.  
6) **Portfolio Website (Meta Exhibit)** — Present as “The Museum Building Itself.” The thumbnail is a tiny floor plan of the page with highlighted rooms. Include the self-reference link: **https://geekip.dev** and a curator-style wink in the copy (“An exhibit that rearranges its own walls daily.”).  
7) **Visitor Information / External Catalogs** (the last box) — Styled like the museum’s “Gift shop & archives” placard, minimal and clean. Provide three large, readable links with small matching icons: **github.com/gevak**, **linkedin.com/in/gevakip**, **facebook.com/geva.kipper**.

To make it feel “ever-changing” without looking chaotic, incorporate a daily “curatorial variation” system in the visual layer: each day the page chooses one of several restrained palettes (e.g., parchment + deep green, parchment + indigo, parchment + oxblood), rotates which artifact is “Featured Exhibit” (slightly larger card with an accent border), and slightly changes the route lines/arrows between cards. Add tiny “catalog marks” that vary daily—stamp text like “RE-CURATED,” a different accession prefix, or a subtle watermark pattern—so returning visitors notice the shift while the layout remains elegant.

Finish with a wide footer that feels like the museum’s wall text at the exit. Include a single credit line: “Site generated by an AI model (ChatGPT) for today’s exhibit.” Next to it (or beneath it), place a clean stopwatch panel labeled like a gallery timer: “Time since 2025‑12‑12 15:43:00” with a live-updating display in **HH:MM:SS**, styled as a small digital placard inset into the paper background. The stopwatch should look like an exhibit conservation monitor—precise, calm, and quietly mesmerizing—closing the page with a sense of ongoing time and continuous re-curation.
