### Portfolio Design: The Ever-Changing Digital Tree

**Overall Concept:**

The website is a single, vertically scrolling page set against a dark, deep-space-blue background with subtle, slowly moving particles, like digital dust. The central element is a single, luminous, minimalist "digital tree" that grows as the user scrolls down the page. The tree is not a literal illustration but is composed of thin, glowing lines of light, akin to a circuit board or a Tron-like data stream. The color of this light is the daily-changing accent color (e.g., electric teal one day, magenta the next).

**Initial View (Above the Fold):**

The user loads the page to see the very base of the tree—its "root" system—a small, intricate knot of glowing light pulsating gently at the bottom center of the screen. Above it, in a clean, elegant, white sans-serif font, is the primary text:

**Geva Kipper**
*Software Engineer at Google, working on the future of search.*

Below this, in a slightly smaller, monospace font that subtly glows with the day's accent color, is the subtitle:

`This portfolio is procedurally generated and re-designed by an AI every 24 hours.`

A small, animated arrow or a soft pulse of light encourages the user to scroll down, initiating the tree's growth.

**Scrolling Interaction & Project Sections:**

As the user scrolls, the main trunk of the digital tree draws itself upwards from the root system, extending through the center of the page. At specific points in the scroll, a major branch will elegantly animate outward from the trunk, alternating between the left and right sides of the screen. At the end of each branch, a hexagonal, semi-transparent "node" or "leaf" materializes.

When a node scrolls into view, it becomes opaque and the branch leading to it pulses brightly once. The content for each project is displayed within this hexagonal frame. The text is crisp white, and all links are styled as clear, tappable buttons that glow with the day's accent color on hover.

**Section 6: This Website**
A final, shorter branch grows to the right, slightly higher than the last. The hexagonal node contains:
*   **Title:** The Digital Tree
*   **Description:** A meta-project; this very portfolio. A single-page, dynamically growing site, re-imagined daily by AI.

**Final Section & Footer:**

As the user reaches the bottom of the page, the main trunk of the tree has reached its full height, and the camera appears to pan back slightly to show the entire tree with all its branches and glowing nodes.

The "root" system at the very bottom, which was visible at the start, now becomes the focal point again. Three main root-tendrils glow brighter than the rest. At the tip of each tendril is a glowing icon and a label for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook, which pulse when hovered over. These are the links.

Finally, centered at the absolute bottom of the page, below the roots, is the footer text in a subtle, smaller grey font:

`Design generated by OpenAI's GPT-4 on a whim.`
`Time since last universal reboot: [ 0000d : 00h : 00m : 00s ]`

The bracketed content is a live stopwatch, continuously counting up in days, hours, minutes, and seconds from the specified date and time of 2025-09-13 00:58:20.
