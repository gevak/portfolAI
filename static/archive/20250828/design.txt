### Portfolio Design: The Alchemist's Bookshelf

**Overall Vibe:** The website presents a single, beautifully rendered, eye-level view of a single shelf in a dimly lit, scholarly study. The aesthetic is a blend of old-world elegance and subtle futuristic magic. The shelf is made of a dark, rich mahogany wood with a slight texture. The background is softly out of focus, hinting at a larger library. The primary light source is a warm, soft glow that seems to emanate from the shelf and the books themselves.

**Header Section:**
At the top of the page, where a traditional header would be, the developer's name, "Geva Kipper," is elegantly engraved into the wooden top of the bookshelf in a classic serif font, appearing as if a master craftsman carved it. Below the name, a small, polished brass plaque is fixed to the wood. On this plaque, the single sentence is inscribed: "Crafting the future of code generation at Google."

Beneath this, centered on the screen but appearing to float just in front of the shelf, is the subtitle: "This site is programmatically redesigned by an AI each day, its form ever-changing." The text has a very subtle, slow-fading "glitch" or "shimmer" effect, as if it's a holographic projection that's constantly refreshing.

**The Bookshelf & Projects:**
The main content area is the bookshelf itself, which houses six distinct, custom-designed books and a small decorative item for social links. The books are not uniform; each has a unique spine design that hints at its content. On initial load, the books are closed on the shelf.

Upon hovering over a book, it levitates slightly forward from the shelf and emits a soft, individual-colored aura. The title on its spine becomes brighter and more legible.

When a book is clicked, a fluid animation occurs: the book glides to the center of the screen, rotates, and opens. The other books and the shelf dim and recede into the background. The open book displays its content across two pages. A small, elegant "X" in the top right corner of the right page allows the user to close the book, which then animates gracefully back to its place on the shelf.

Here is the design for each book (from left to right on the shelf):

1.  **GlglStats:** A book bound in dark grey leather. The spine features a debossed audio waveform that glows with a cyan light on hover. The title is "GlglStats."
    *   **Left Page:** "A Python project measuring the repetitiveness of pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression."
    *   **Right Page:** Two large, stylized buttons. The first, labeled "Explore the Data," is shaped like a vinyl record and links to the project site. The second, labeled "Watch The Talk," features a play icon and links to the YouTube video.

2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk:** A shorter, thicker book that looks like a city planner's ledger, bound in concrete-textured grey material. The spine shows a minimalist, abstract heatmap pattern in red and orange. The title is "Ahuzat Dibuk."
    *   **Left Page:** "A Python scraping project that visualizes car parking occupancy in Tel-Aviv to help residents find parking."
    *   **Right Page:** Three "paperclip" icons, each holding a different "news clipping" that links out. The clippings have headline-style text: "Channel 13 News," "Mako Feature," and "Original TLV Post."

3.  **2D Part Orienting:** A tall, slender book with a cover made of brushed metal. The spine has an intricate, laser-etched geometric pattern of a complex polygon. The title is "2D Part Orienting."
    *   **Left Page:** "A C++ implementation of an efficient algorithm for constructing a 'push plan' to orient a given polygon, contributed to a CGAL library."
    *   **Right Page:** A single, prominent link styled as a blueprint schematic that reads "Review the Algorithm & Code" and points to the project page.

4.  **The Turing Jest:** A playful-looking book bound in purple velvet with a classic comedy mask embossed in gold on the spine. The title is "The Turing Jest."
    *   **Left Page:** "An LLM-powered arena where AI models compete to generate and explain puns, with user-based ratings."
    *   **Right Page:** A link styled as a jester's scepter. The text on the link reads, "Challenge the AIs," and directs to the project site.

5.  **Rhymes of Israel:** This "book" looks more like a rolled-up scroll of parchment, tied with a blue ribbon. The title, "Rhymes of Israel," is written in a calligraphic font along its length.
    *   **Left Page (appearing on the unrolled scroll):** "A Chrome extension that uses an LLM to rewrite Israeli news headlines into comedic, high-school-style rhymes."
    *   **Right Page:** A link that looks like a wax seal stamp with a Chrome icon in the center. The text around the seal reads, "Install from Chrome Web Store."

6.  **This Website:** A truly meta book. The cover is a perfect, flawless mirror that reflects a slightly distorted and ethereal version of the other books on the shelf. The spine is obsidian black with an infinity symbol (âˆž) that pulses with a soft white light. The title is "The Architect."
    *   **Left Page:** "A self-referential project: the very portfolio you are browsing now, designed to showcase projects in a unique, interactive format."
    *   **Right Page:** A link that reads "View Source (You are here)" and points to geekip.dev. The link appears to be looking back at the user through a small keyhole.

**Social Links Section:**
To the far right of the books, resting on the shelf, is not another book but a vintage-style brass rolodex. Clicking on it causes it to spin and land on the first contact card: GitHub, showing the logo and username. Clicking again flips to the LinkedIn card, and then to the Facebook card. Each card is a direct link.

**Footer:**
At the very bottom of the page, below the bookshelf, is a simple, dark footer bar that stays fixed at the bottom of the viewport. On the left, it reads: "Design Concept by [AI Model Name]." On the right, there is a digital stopwatch with a clean, monospaced font, displaying the time elapsed since 2025-08-28 01:02:47 in `HHH:MM:SS` format, constantly ticking upwards.
