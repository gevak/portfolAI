# Portfolio Website Design: ML Interest Prediction

## Core Concept
A clean, minimalist portfolio that transforms into a personalized experience through a machine learning model. As visitors browse, the site subtly tracks their interaction patterns (hover time, clicks, scroll patterns) to predict which projects they're most interested in, then dynamically reorganizes content to prioritize those interests.

## Header & Introduction
- Large, bold header with "Geva Kipper" and a typewriter-effect subtitle showing: "Software Engineer at Google, working on large-scale infrastructure and machine learning systems."
- Below this, an animated, subtle text explaining: "This website redesigns itself daily via AI, ensuring a unique experience every 24 hours."
- A small, unobtrusive notification appears: "I'm learning your interests as you browse..."

## Visual Design
- Monochromatic color scheme with accents of electric blue that highlight elements based on the ML prediction.
- Gaussian blur effects and subtle particle animations in the background that follow cursor movement.
- Custom cursor that leaves a fading trail showing the ML model "learning" from movements.

## Project Boxes Implementation
- Five project boxes arranged in a staggered, asymmetric grid that subtly reshuffles as the ML model predicts interests.
- Each box starts as a minimalist card with project name and an abstract geometric shape representing the project.
- On hover, cards expand smoothly to reveal details with a parallax effect on images/icons.
- Project boxes have thin, glowing borders that intensify on boxes the ML model predicts are most relevant to the visitor.

## Projects Content
1. **GlglStats Box**: Features a dynamic audio waveform visualization that responds to hover. Includes embedded video thumbnail and site link with a "compression pattern" animated background.

2. **Ahuzat Dibuk Box**: Showcases a miniature interactive heat-map that cycles through sample data. News links appear with media outlet logos. Features parking-themed iconography.

3. **2D Part Orienting Box**: Contains an animated demonstration of the polygon orientation algorithm working on sample shapes in real-time. Link to the full code repository moves like a rotating polygon.

4. **Portfolio Website Box**: Meta-referential design with animated frame showing "this website" within itself, creating a recursive visual effect. Self-link pulses with a breathing animation.

5. **Social Links Box**: Three floating, rotating 3D icons representing GitHub (cube), LinkedIn (cylinder), and Facebook (sphere) that expand to show the actual platform logos when approached by cursor.

## ML Interest Visualization
- A thin, discrete bar at the top of the page visualizes the ML model's confidence in its predictions about visitor interests.
- Small indicators next to each project show how the model is ranking them based on visitor behavior.
- A "Reset ML Predictions" button lets visitors start fresh if they want to explore without the algorithm's influence.

## Footer
- Elegant stopwatch counting time since May 14, 2025, 01:06:14 with a minimalist animated hourglass icon.
- Credit line: "Design generated by [AI model name] on [generation date]" with a subtle fade-in effect.
- Dark/light mode toggle in the bottom corner that inverts the color scheme while preserving the ML functionality.

## Responsive Behavior
- On mobile devices, the project grid transforms into a carousel that automatically highlights predicted interests first.
- Touch gestures allow swiping between projects, with haptic feedback when the ML model updates its predictions.
