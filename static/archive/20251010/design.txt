# Code Editor Theme Portfolio Design

The website opens as a full-screen dark-themed IDE interface with a rich, sophisticated color palette reminiscent of premium code editors like VS Code's Dark+ or Monokai Pro. The main viewport is dominated by a tabbed interface at the top, with each of Geva's seven projects represented as an open file tab. The tabs display creative file names: `glgl_stats.py`, `ahuzat_dibuk.py`, `part_orienting.cpp`, `turing_jest.ts`, `rhymes_of_israel.crx`, `portfolio.html`, and `social_links.json`.

The leftmost sidebar resembles a typical IDE file explorer, displaying a collapsible tree structure showing a fake project hierarchy. The root folder is labeled "geva_kipper_portfolio/" with subfolders like "projects/", "about/", and "external/". This sidebar features subtle hover animations and folder icons that glow when active. A minimap appears on the right edge, showing a scaled-down preview of the entire page content with a highlighted viewport indicator.

At the very top, above the tabs, sits a sleek header bar styled like an IDE title bar. It displays "Geva Kipper" in monospace font alongside a status indicator showing "Currently: Building innovative solutions at Google" with a small Google-colored dot animation. Directly below this, in the toolbar area where IDE extensions typically live, appears the subtitle in a lighter gray: "⚡ Portfolio auto-redesigned daily by AI • Forever evolving" with a subtle pulsing icon.

The main content area beneath the tabs displays each project as a "code file" with syntax-highlighted content. Each project section is formatted as commented code blocks with the project name as a large comment header (using `//` or `#` depending on the tab's language). Project descriptions are written as multi-line comments, while links appear as function calls or import statements. For example, GlglStats shows Python-style docstrings with the description, followed by lines like `visit_site("https://glglstats.geekip.dev")` and `watch_presentation("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo")` as clickable, syntax-highlighted code.

Each project section includes decorative line numbers on the left margin, matching the language of its tab. The background of each section alternates very subtly between slightly different shades of the dark theme to create visual separation without breaking the IDE immersion. Hover effects on links make them glow with an editor-style selection highlight in a semi-transparent blue or gold color.

The social links section (`social_links.json`) is formatted as a beautifully indented JSON object with glowing syntax highlighting, each link rendered as a key-value pair with icon emojis as decorative elements. The links have a special hover effect that makes them appear to be actively edited, with a blinking cursor animation.

The bottom status bar matches typical IDE footers, displaying on the left: "AI Designer: Claude (Anthropic) | Theme: Dark+ Professional" and on the right, a live-updating stopwatch showing "Uptime since last redesign: [X]h [Y]m [Z]s" counting from October 10, 2025, 01:02:46. The status bar also includes fake but aesthetically pleasing details like "UTF-8 | LF | TypeScript | 7 Projects" with small icons.

Smooth scroll-snapping brings each tab's content into focus as you navigate, with the active tab highlighting with an accent underline in a vibrant cyan or gold color. The entire page features micro-interactions: tabs slightly lift on hover, the minimap's viewport indicator smoothly follows scrolling, and occasional subtle particle effects suggest "code compilation" happening in the background. A custom scrollbar styled to match premium IDE themes completes the immersive experience.
