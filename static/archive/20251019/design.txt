# Code Constellation Map Design

## Visual Concept & Layout

The entire page presents as a deep space environment with a rich, dark navy-to-black gradient background (#0a0e27 to #000000) featuring subtle, slowly twinkling stars scattered across the viewport. At the center of the screen, "GEVA KIPPER" appears in large, luminous white text (80px, thin weight, letter-spaced) with a soft white glow effect, positioned like a central celestial body. Directly beneath, in smaller glowing text (18px), appears "Building intelligent systems at Google" followed by an even smaller, subtly animated line in soft cyan (#64ffda) that reads "This portfolio constellation reshapes itself daily through AI—forever in flux."

## Project Constellation System

Six project "stars" orbit around the central name in an elliptical pattern, each represented by a glowing orb of different sizes based on project significance. GlglStats glows in warm amber (#ffa726), Ahuzat Dibuk in electric blue (#42a5f5), 2D Part Orienting in emerald green (#66bb6a), The Turing Jest in playful magenta (#ec407a), Rhymes of Israel in golden yellow (#ffee58), and the meta portfolio project in prismatic white with rainbow edges. These orbs pulse gently with a breathing animation (2-3 second cycles).

When hovering over any project orb, it expands by 30% and brightens, while thin, shimmering connecting lines (particle trails) draw themselves between related projects—creating visible "constellations" of technological themes. For example, GlglStats connects to Ahuzat Dibuk (both Python data projects), The Turing Jest connects to Rhymes of Israel (both LLM projects), and all projects have faint lines connecting back to the central portfolio star, creating a living web of innovation.

## Project Detail Panels

Clicking a project orb causes it to move to the foreground while others dim to 40% opacity. A translucent glass-morphism panel (frosted dark background with subtle blur, rounded 20px corners, 1px glowing border matching the orb's color) slides in from the right side, occupying about 40% of the screen width. Inside, the project name appears in large text with the orb's signature color, followed by a concise description in clean white text (16px, line-height 1.8). 

Links appear as glowing constellation markers—small circular icons with appropriate symbols (globe for websites, play button for videos, newspaper for articles, code brackets for GitHub). These link icons connect to each other with faint dotted lines within the panel, maintaining the constellation metaphor. Hovering over links creates a subtle shooting star animation from the link to the panel edge.

## Social Constellation Footer

At the bottom right of the viewport, a smaller constellation cluster represents social links. Three smaller orbs (GitHub in soft white, LinkedIn in professional blue #0077b5, Facebook in its signature blue #1877f2) form a tight triangle formation with the seventh "box" designation. These remain visible at all times, pulsing gently. Hovering reveals the platform names in small text below each orb.

## Time Signature & AI Credit

In the bottom left corner, ethereal text displays "Constellation designed by [Your AI Model Name]" in subtle gray (#666), followed by a live-updating stopwatch showing "Time since last stellar formation: XXh XXm XXs" counting up from October 19, 2025, 01:10:17. The numbers flicker very subtly like distant starlight, updating each second with a gentle fade transition.

## Interactive Elements & Polish

The cursor becomes a small crosshair with a trailing comet tail effect as it moves. Smooth parallax scrolling (if the user scrolls, though single-page) makes distant background stars move slower than foreground elements, creating depth. All transitions use smooth easing functions (cubic-bezier) lasting 0.6-0.8 seconds. Occasional shooting stars streak across the background randomly every 8-12 seconds, completely decorative. The entire design is fully responsive—on mobile, the orbs arrange in a vertical spiral pattern descending from the name, and panels occupy full width when activated.
