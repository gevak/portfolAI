A single-page “choose-your-own-adventure” portfolio that reads like an interactive career storybook. The page opens with a full-bleed hero panel styled as a modern “game title screen”: **Geva Kipper** in large, elegant type, followed by one crisp sentence about his current role at Google (e.g., “Geva Kipper is currently a software engineer at Google, building scalable systems and product infrastructure.”). Under it, a subtitle in a smaller, slightly italicized font: **“This portfolio is re-designed each day by AI—so it’s always slightly different.”** A prominent “Begin Adventure” button scrolls the user into the narrative, while subtle animated background elements (thin contour lines or star-map dots) drift slowly, creating an understated sense of motion without feeling gimmicky.

The main content is a single vertical “story path” that feels like a decision tree, but remains one page: a slim timeline spine runs down the center, and each project appears as a **choice card** branching left or right like story options. Each card is one of the **boxes/sections**, but presented as a “decision” the user can take—hovering highlights it like a selectable dialogue option, and clicking expands the card inline (accordion-style) to reveal details, links, and media. The default view shows only the title, a one-line “plot hook,” and a small icon (Python/C++/LLM/Chrome/etc.). When a card expands, it reveals a short narrative paragraph written like a chapter outcome (“You chose to measure repetition like a music detective…”) plus the practical project description, plus the required links. Completed/expanded choices gain a subtle “visited” treatment (e.g., a thin gold border and a small bookmark notch), reinforcing the adventure metaphor.

Six to seven main cards are arranged as chapters with distinct visual motifs, but all share a consistent layout: title, short hook line, body content, then link buttons. Use an elegant card design: soft shadows, rounded corners, strong whitespace, and a restrained palette (dark ink background with warm off-white cards, or light background with deep navy cards), plus one accent color that shifts slightly each day (reinforcing the “AI re-designed daily” subtitle). Each card includes a tiny “Path Tag” label at the top (e.g., “Data Story,” “Geometry Quest,” “LLM Arena,” “Civic Scrape,” “Meta Ending”), and a “Continue” micro-button that simply scrolls to the next card once expanded.

**Card 1: “GlglStats”** appears early as a “Data Detective” branch. The expanded view includes: “GlglStats — Python project measuring repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression; includes visualizations of repetition patterns in famous songs.” Include two clear call-to-action buttons: **Visit: https://glglstats.geekip.dev** and **Watch PyData TLV talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo**. The video is embedded in-card (responsive), with a poster frame and a minimal play overlay; the card background might include a faint waveform grid or tape-loop motif.

**Card 2: “Ahuzat Dibuk”** is presented as the “Civic Wizard” choice. The expanded card describes it as a Python scraping + data visualization project collecting Tel-Aviv parking-lot occupancy, generating heatmaps for residents. It includes three link buttons grouped under a “Press & Publication” subheader:  
- https://13tv.co.il/item/news/domestic/internal/parking-902956407/  
- https://www.mako.co.il/nexter-news/Article-ae43964b891bf71027.htm  
- https://www.facebook.com/groups/secrettelaviv/posts/10159636301195943/  
The visual motif could be a faint city-grid/heatmap texture that only becomes visible on hover, keeping the base layout clean.

**Card 3: “2D Part Orienting”** becomes the “Geometry Forge” branch. Expanded content: “C++ implementation in an open-source computational geometry library of an efficient algorithm constructing a push plan to orient a polygon.” Provide a single strong link button: **More info & code: https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/**. Add a minimal inline SVG illustration (purely decorative) of a polygon with arrows indicating “push plan” steps, animated subtly when expanded (e.g., arrows fade in sequence).

**Card 4: “The Turing Jest”** is the “Arena of Puns” choice. Expanded content: “An LMSYS-like arena where LLMs compete at making and explaining puns, rated by users.” Include a bold button: **Enter the arena: https://jest.geekip.dev**. The card’s micro-interaction is playful but controlled: when hovered, the title slightly “wobbles” like a typographic pun, and on expand, a small “crowd meter” bar animates once, then stays still.

**Card 5: “Rhymes of Israel”** is the “Headline Bard” choice. Expanded content: “Chrome extension using an LLM to rewrite Israeli news headlines into comedic rhymes in the style of a highschool yearbook.” Include a prominent install link button: **Install: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eainginjgdkpgolpjniijdihfbeeeklb**. The visual motif is a subtle notebook margin / yearbook doodle line at the card edge—kept monochrome and tasteful.

**Card 6: “Portfolio Website (Meta Ending)”** is written like a final narrative twist: the adventure leads back to the artifact itself. Expanded content frames it as “A portfolio website project (how meta!): this very choose-your-own-adventure site.” Include a self-reference button: **https://geekip.dev**. This card can visually “glitch” once on expansion (a clean, brief distortion that resolves instantly), reinforcing the meta effect without being distracting.

**Card 7 (Last): “Epilogue / Links”** is the closing chapter and social hub, containing three clean icon+text links aligned in a neat row (stacked on mobile):  
- GitHub: **github.com/gevak**  
- LinkedIn: **linkedin.com/in/gevakip**  
- Facebook: **facebook.com/geva.kipper**  
This final box reads like the “Choose your next quest” screen, inviting contact. The timeline spine ends here with a small “THE END?” marker, hinting the story continues.

At the bottom, a slim footer bar contains: **“Created by OpenAI (ChatGPT)”** as the credit line, styled subtly (small caps or light weight). Next to it is a live **stopwatch** labeled “Time since 2025-12-29 01:16:22” showing **HH:MM:SS** counting up in real time. The stopwatch is designed like an elegant instrument—monospace digits, thin border, and a faint ticking animation on the separator dots—so it feels intentional and premium rather than a debug widget. The page ends with generous whitespace, leaving a calm, polished finish after the narrative journey.
