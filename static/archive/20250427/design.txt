# Portfolio Design Concept: Interactive Code Review Experience

## Overall Theme
A dark-themed, terminal-inspired interface that transforms Geva's portfolio into an interactive code review session. The site simulates a modern code editor with syntax highlighting, complete with comment threads and review annotations.

## Header
- Large text displaying "Geva Kipper" in a monospaced font, styled as if typed in a terminal
- Subtitle: "Senior Software Engineer @ Google" followed by a blinking cursor
- Small, elegant note: "This site is redesigned daily by AI and is ever-changing" with a subtle animation

## Navigation
- Mimics a code editor's file tabs across the top
- Each project is a "file" that can be clicked to view
- Current file is highlighted, others appear dimmed

## Project Presentation Style
Each project appears as a code file with:
- File name and extension in the tab (e.g., "GlglStats.py")
- Line numbers along the left side
- Syntax-highlighted code snippets showing key parts of each project
- "Comment bubbles" in the margin that expand when hovered to show details
- Interactive "+comment" buttons allowing visitors to leave notes (stored in local storage)

## Project Sections

1. **GlglStats Section**
   - Python code showing the compression algorithm
   - Embedded visualization of song repetition patterns
   - Links styled as import statements: `import GlglStats from "https://glglstats.onrender.com/"`
   - Video embed styled as a console output window: `>> python play_conference_video.py`

2. **Ahuzat Dibuk Section**
   - Data visualization mockups shown as output from code execution
   - News coverage links styled as documentation comments
   - Animated heatmap transition showing parking lot occupancy changes

3. **2D Part Orienting Section**
   - C++ code snippets with algorithm visualization
   - Polygon orientation sequence shown as an animated git diff view
   - Repository link styled as an include statement

4. **Portfolio Website Section**
   - Meta section showing the site's own code
   - Self-referential link appears as a recursive function call
   - Comment: "You are here" with an arrow pointing to the current line

5. **Contact Section**
   - Social links presented as a JSON configuration object
   - Each link has a small icon represented in ASCII art
   - Hovering reveals the full colorful icon

## Interactive Elements
- Visitor comments appear as GitHub-style review annotations
- Code folding functionality for sections (expand/collapse)
- Terminal-style typing animation for text as you scroll
- Syntax highlighting changes subtly on hover
- "Run" button for each project that animates to show project results

## Footer
- AI credit styled as a commented line: `/* Site designed by [AI Model] */`
- Stopwatch displayed as a running terminal command: `$ uptime -s "2025-04-27 01:07:42" | [RUNNING COUNTER]`
- Small terminal prompt at the bottom allowing visitors to "type commands" (easter eggs)

## Animation & Transitions
- Smooth fade-in of code sections as you scroll
- Text appears with a subtle typewriter effect
- Code review comments slide in from the margin when posted
- Projects transition like switching files in a code editor

## Responsiveness
- On mobile, transforms into a simplified terminal view
- Projects accessible via command inputs (e.g., "cd GlglStats")
- Maintains dark theme with high contrast for readability
