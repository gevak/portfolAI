# Interactive Terminal Portfolio Design for Geva Kipper

## Core Concept
A full-screen terminal interface that simulates a UNIX/Linux command-line environment. Visitors navigate the portfolio by typing commands, with an authentic terminal aesthetic featuring a blinking cursor, monospaced font, and occasional "system" messages.

## Layout & Interaction

The page opens with a terminal boot sequence animation showing system startup messages, followed by a welcome message displaying "Geva Kipper - Software Engineer at Google" and a subtitle explaining "This website is re-designed daily by AI and is ever-changing."

A blinking prompt (geva@portfolio:~$) appears with a help message showing available commands: `projects`, `about`, `contact`, `clear`.

When typing `projects`, a list of numbered projects appears. Users can type the project number or name to see details.

Visual transitions should include subtle terminal effects like scan lines, minimal screen flicker, and typing sounds (toggleable).

## Project Sections

Each project appears as a "file" with:

1. **GlglStats**:
   - ASCII art visualization of sound waves
   - Project description with syntax highlighting for technical terms
   - Terminal-style links: `[WEBSITE]` and `[VIDEO]` that highlight on hover

2. **Ahuzat Dibuk**:
   - Simple ASCII map of Tel Aviv with parking indicators
   - News coverage links displayed as `[NEWS_1]`, `[NEWS_2]`
   - Original publication as `[ORIGINAL_POST]`

3. **Portfolio Website**: 
   - Self-referential terminal window within the terminal
   - Meta message about recursive design
   - Link displayed as `[CURRENT_SESSION]`

4. **Social Links**:
   - Displayed as network connections with ping status
   - GitHub, LinkedIn and Facebook links with ASCII icons
   - Typing `connect github` would open the link

## Visual Design

Color scheme: Dark background (deep charcoal #121212) with green (#33FF33) or amber (#FFBF00) text. Option to switch color schemes using `theme` command.

Custom cursor that mimics terminal blinking cursor.

Subtle particle effects resembling dust on an old CRT monitor.

Easter eggs: typing certain commands reveals hidden animations or jokes.

## Footer

Fixed-position footer showing:
- "Generated by [AI Model Name]"
- Running stopwatch displaying time since 2025-04-02 11:20:03 in terminal format
- Small terminal icon that when clicked reveals the "about" command info
