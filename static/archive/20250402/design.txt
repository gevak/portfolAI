# Interactive 3D Room Explorer Portfolio Design

## Main Concept
A 3D virtual room where the visitor can explore using mouse movement or arrow keys. The room would be designed as a modern tech workspace with each interactive object representing different projects and sections of Geva Kipper's portfolio.

## Room Layout
The room features a minimalist aesthetic with subtle tech-inspired elements - clean lines, a subtle color palette of deep blues, whites, and accent colors. Ambient light casts gentle shadows, creating depth and dimension to the space.

## Header and Navigation
Upon entering the site, Geva Kipper's name appears in a modern, sans-serif font floating in the center of the screen with a subtle animation. Below his name is a single line: "Currently developing AI solutions at Google."

A small subtitle appears beneath: "This portfolio room is redesigned daily by AI - what you see is unique to today."

Navigation is intuitive - as the user moves their cursor (or uses arrow keys), the view pans around the room. A subtle compass or mini-map in the corner helps with orientation.

## Interactive Objects

1. **Smart TV on Wall**: Displays the GlglStats project. When clicked, it expands to show project details, with buttons for the website link and YouTube presentation. The TV screen shows a looping animation of music visualization patterns from the project.

2. **City Map on Desk**: A 3D model of Tel Aviv with glowing heat map overlays representing the Ahuzat Dibuk parking project. Hovering over different areas shows parking statistics. News article links appear as digital newspaper clippings next to the map.

3. **Laptop on Desk**: Screen displays a miniature version of this very portfolio website (meta reference). When clicked, the laptop screen expands to show details about the portfolio design approach, with a link to the actual site.

4. **Digital Bookshelf**: Contains three digital objects representing social profiles - a GitHub code repository, LinkedIn profile book, and Facebook photo album. Each glows subtly when hovered and can be clicked to access the respective profiles.

## Interactive Elements
- Objects emit a subtle glow when the user approaches them
- Soft ambient music plays in the background (toggle-able)
- Easter eggs hidden throughout the room (like a coffee mug that reveals a fun fact when clicked)
- Day/night cycle that subtly changes the lighting based on the visitor's local time

## Responsive Design
The 3D room adapts to different screen sizes:
- Desktop: Full 3D navigation experience
- Tablet: Simplified 3D view with touch controls
- Mobile: "Dollhouse view" that shows a cutaway of the room with tappable objects

## Footer
A minimalist footer at the bottom of the viewport shows:
1. Credit: "Room designed by [Your AI Model Name]"
2. An elegant stopwatch counting time since April 2, 2025, 01:02:20, with glowing digits for hours, minutes, and seconds

## Technical Notes
The design uses Three.js for 3D rendering, modern CSS animations for transitions, and responsive design principles throughout to ensure smooth performance across devices.
