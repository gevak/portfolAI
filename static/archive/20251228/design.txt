Make the entire single-page site feel like you’re landing on a beautifully lit, slightly futuristic mechanical keyboard on a dark desk. The hero view is a top-down, full-width “keyboard” that’s actually a responsive grid of keys (rounded rectangles with subtle bevel, soft shadows, and a gentle backlight glow). Centered above the keyboard, place the name **Geva Kipper** in a clean modern sans-serif (large, confident), with one crisp sentence beneath: **“Software engineer at Google, currently building and improving large-scale systems that power real user experiences.”** Immediately under that, a smaller subtitle line: **“This portfolio is re-designed each day by AI—so it’s always a little different.”** The daily redesign concept should be expressed visually via tiny, tasteful “variation cues” (e.g., accent color shifts, background grain pattern, keycap legend style, or a small “Today’s layout” tag in the corner) without changing the information architecture.

The keyboard is the navigation and the delight: each “key” is labeled like a keycap legend and opens a corresponding section. Use a mix of familiar key labels and custom legends (e.g., **GLGL**, **DIBUK**, **ORIENT**, **JEST**, **RHYME**, **META**, **LINKS**) so it reads instantly as a keyboard but clearly maps to the projects. When a key is clicked/tapped, it depresses with a satisfying micro-animation, the backlight under that key intensifies, and the page smoothly transitions to a “raised panel” area directly beneath the keyboard (still on the same page). The opened content appears like an elegant “key tray” drawer sliding out from under the keyboard: glassy/blurred background panel, clean typography, and a small breadcrumb showing which key is active. Keep the keyboard always visible (sticky at top on desktop; collapsible on mobile into a compact “mini-keyboard” strip with the same keys).

Below the keyboard, lay out **seven** sleek content boxes/sections in a single-column flow (or two columns on wide screens), each styled as a refined card that visually echoes keycaps: rounded corners, subtle chamfered edges, and a minimal backlit top border in the day’s accent color. Each section has: a bold title, a one-line “legend” descriptor (like a keycap sublabel), a concise description paragraph, and clear action links. Suggested section content and presentation:
1) **GlglStats** (legend: “PYTHON • COMPRESSION • VISUALIZATION”) — describe it as a Python project measuring repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using **LZ77 compression**, plus visualizations of repetition patterns across famous songs. Include two prominent actions: **Visit: https://glglstats.geekip.dev** and **Watch talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo** (embed a clean video preview inside the card with a minimalist frame).
2) **Ahuzat Dibuk** (legend: “SCRAPING • DATA VIZ • TEL AVIV”) — describe the scraping + data visualization project collecting Tel-Aviv parking-lot occupancy stats and generating heatmaps for residents. Include a “Press” row with two neat link chips: **https://13tv.co.il/item/news/domestic/internal/parking-902956407/** and **https://www.mako.co.il/nexter-news/Article-ae43964b891bf71027.htm** plus a “Original post” chip: **https://www.facebook.com/groups/secrettelaviv/posts/10159636301195943/**.
3) **2D Part Orienting** (legend: “C++ • COMPUTATIONAL GEOMETRY • OPEN SOURCE”) — present it as a C++ implementation in an open-source computational geometry library of an efficient algorithm constructing a “push plan” to orient a polygon. Include a single strong CTA: **https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/** and a small diagrammatic accent (a thin-line polygon + arrows motif) inside the card header.
4) **The Turing Jest** (legend: “LLM ARENA • HUMOR • USER RATING”) — describe it as an LMSYS-like arena where LLMs compete at making and explaining puns, rated by users. Add the CTA: **https://jest.geekip.dev**. Visually, give this card a playful but still elegant twist: a subtle typographic “pun” motif in the background (barely-there repeated glyphs) and a “Vote / Judge” button style.
5) **Rhymes of Israel** (legend: “CHROME EXTENSION • LLM • SATIRE”) — present it as a Chrome extension rewriting Israeli news headlines into comedic rhymes in a highschool-yearbook style. Add the install link as the main CTA: **https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eainginjgdkpgolpjniijdihfbeeeklb**. Include a small “before → after” headline snippet area (styled like a yearbook caption strip) for flavor.
6) **Portfolio (Meta)** (legend: “DESIGN • INTERACTION • SINGLE-PAGE”) — explicitly call out that this very site is a portfolio project, leaning into the “how meta!” vibe. Add a self-reference CTA: **https://geekip.dev**. This card can show a tiny “layout generator” badge indicating today’s AI aesthetic choices (e.g., “Accent: cobalt / Keycap: matte / Grain: low”), reinforcing the ever-changing theme without being gimmicky.
7) **Links** (legend: “CONNECT”) — a clean row of icon+text buttons for: **github.com/gevak**, **linkedin.com/in/gevakip**, **facebook.com/geva.kipper**. Make these buttons feel like special keys (e.g., long “spacebar” style for GitHub, “enter” style for LinkedIn), consistent with the keyboard theme.

Throughout, keep the color palette restrained and elegant: deep charcoal/near-black background, soft off-white text, and one daily accent color (cobalt, emerald, amber, violet—rotating subtly). Use gentle ambient motion: slow-moving gradient glow under the keyboard, faint dust/grain texture, and hover states that mimic keycap shine. Typography should be crisp and technical: a modern sans-serif for headings, and a highly legible sans-serif for body; optionally use a monospaced font sparingly for “key legends” and link chips. All motion should be fast and refined (no bouncy effects), with accessibility in mind (clear focus rings, reduced-motion option).

At the bottom, add a minimal footer bar that feels like the keyboard’s metal chassis edge. Include a credit line: **“Site concept and daily redesign authored by ChatGPT (OpenAI).”** Next to it (or aligned right), place a live **stopwatch** labeled **“Time since 2025-12-28 01:18:47:”** displaying **hours : minutes : seconds**, updating continuously. The stopwatch styling should match the “keyboard legend” aesthetic—monospaced, subtle backlit capsule—so it feels like part of the instrument panel rather than a generic widget.
