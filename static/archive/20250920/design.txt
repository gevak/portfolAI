### Website Design: The Explorer's Sea Map

**Overall Concept:**

The website is a single, vertically scrolling page that functions as an antique, animated sea map. The background is a deep, dark teal-blue ocean with subtle, slow-moving procedural waves and faint light refractions, giving a sense of depth and life. The user's scroll action is their "voyage," taking them south across the map to discover different islands, each representing a portfolio project. The visual style is a blend of vintage cartography and clean, modern UI, using parchment textures, hand-drawn-style illustrations, and elegant typography.

**Header Section (The Chart's Title):**

At the very top of the page, floating over the northern expanse of the ocean, is the title.

*   **Main Title:** "Geva Kipper" is written in a grand, serif font reminiscent of old map-making, with a subtle gold-foil texture.
*   **Job Description:** Directly below the name, in a smaller, clean sans-serif font: "Currently navigating the complex waters of software engineering at Google."
*   **AI Subtitle:** A small, rectangular box styled like a brass plaque is affixed just below. It reads: "This chart is re-drawn daily by an AI cartographer and is thus ever-changing." The text within this plaque has a very subtle, intermittent digital glitch or flicker effect to visually represent its AI origin.
*   **Call to Action:** A faint, animated compass rose at the bottom of the initial view gently pulses, with its "South" marker glowing, encouraging the user to scroll down and begin their exploration.

**The Voyage & The Islands (Project Sections):**

As the user scrolls down, a faint, dotted line animates on the map, charting a course from one "island" to the next. Each island is a unique, illustrated landmass that drifts into view. When an island is hovered over, it glows softly and its name appears in an elegant script font. Clicking on an island triggers a modal overlay.

This overlay is styled like a page from a Captain's Logbook, with a textured parchment background and clean, legible text. It contains the project details, and a small, hand-drawn "X" on the map island indicates which one is being viewed.

1.  **Island 1: GlglStats (The Isle of Echoes)**
    *   **Island Shape:** A landmass shaped like a stylized soundwave or a G-clef musical note.
    *   **Logbook Modal:** Titled "Log Entry: The Isle of Echoes (GlglStats)". It describes the Python project. The links are presented as icons: a video-player icon for the PyData talk and a spyglass icon for the live site.

2.  **Island 2: Ahuzat Dibuk (The Gridlock Archipelago)**
    *   **Island Shape:** A cluster of small, square islands arranged in a perfect grid, resembling a city block. One of the islands glows with a faint red-to-green heat-map animation.
    *   **Logbook Modal:** Titled "Log Entry: The Gridlock Archipelago (Ahuzat Dibuk)". It describes the parking project. The links are presented as newspaper icons for the news stories and a "message in a bottle" icon for the original Facebook post.

3.  **Island 3: 2D Part Orienting (The Crystalline Atoll)**
    *   **Island Shape:** A sharp, geometric island with crystalline structures, resembling a complex polygon.
    *   **Logbook Modal:** Titled "Log Entry: The Crystalline Atoll (2D Part Orienting)". It describes the C++ computational geometry project. The link is presented with a gear-and-compass icon for the "Code & Info".

4.  **Island 4: The Turing Jest (The Jester's Rock)**
    *   **Island Shape:** A single, isolated island shaped like a comedy/tragedy mask or a large question mark.
    *   **Logbook Modal:** Titled "Log Entry: The Jester's Rock (The Turing Jest)". It details the LLM arena project. The link to the site is presented with a laughing skull icon.

5.  **Island 5: Rhymes of Israel (The Scribe's Peninsula)**
    *   **Island Shape:** A long, curved landmass that looks like a quill pen or a partially unrolled scroll.
    *   **Logbook Modal:** Titled "Log Entry: The Scribe's Peninsula (Rhymes of Israel)". It presents the Chrome extension. The installation link is a button styled like a red wax seal with a Chrome logo imprinted on it.

6.  **Island 6: This Portfolio (The Cartographer's Rose)**
    *   **Island Shape:** A perfectly circular island that is, in fact, an interactive, spinning compass rose.
    *   **Logbook Modal:** Titled "Log Entry: The Cartographer's Rose (geekip.dev)". It describes the meta-project. The link is presented with a ship's-helm icon, which, when clicked, simply closes the modal and re-centers the page, subtly reinforcing the self-reference.

**Social Links Section (Messages in Bottles):**

After the final project island, the user scrolls into a deeper, darker part of the ocean. Here, at the bottom of the map, there are no more islands. Instead, three glass bottles bob gently in the water. Each bottle has a small, rolled-up parchment scroll inside with an icon visible through the glass (GitHub's Octocat, LinkedIn's "in", Facebook's "f"). Clicking on a bottle triggers a satisfying "uncorking" sound effect and a subtle animation, before opening the corresponding link in a new tab.

**Footer (The Seafloor):**

The page ends at the seafloor, a dark, sandy texture with faint light rays filtering from above. Etched into what looks like a sunken stone tablet are the final details:

*   **AI Credit:** "This sea map's design was conceived by the generative AI model, GPT-4."
*   **Live Stopwatch:** Beside the credit, there is a device styled like a brass-and-glass ship's chronometer. Inside, digital numbers are actively counting up the hours, minutes, and seconds that have passed since 2025-09-20 01:02:16, labeled "Time Since Last Charting."
