### Portfolio Design: The "De/Cipher" Sequence

**Overall Concept:** The website loads as an interactive, minimalist "hacker" terminal. The user's interaction (a single command) "decrypts" the system, causing the terminal interface to dramatically transform and reassemble itself into a sleek, modern, single-page portfolio. The aesthetic transitions from raw, retro-tech to clean, futuristic elegance.

### Phase 1: The "Hacker" Introduction

**Initial View:** The visitor is greeted with a full-screen, dark terminal interface. The background is a very dark charcoal (#111), not pure black. A single, green, blinking cursor pulses in the top left.

**The Sequence:**
1.  After a two-second pause, a line of text is typed out automatically, letter by letter, with a classic keyboard clacking sound effect:
    `> INITIATE G_KIPPER.SYS`
2.  After a moment, a series of "system checks" rapidly scroll down the screen, too fast to read in detail, but with recognizable keywords. This text will be slightly blurred and have a subtle "CRT monitor" scan-line effect.
    ```
    ...DECOMPRESSING KERNEL
    ...LOADING AI DESIGN MODULE v.2.7.1
    ...PARSING PROJECT_DATA.JSON
    ...ENCRYPTION LAYER DETECTED
    ...AWAITING DECRYPTION KEY
    ```
3.  The scrolling stops. A new line appears below, with the blinking cursor next to it:
    `> ENTER COMMAND TO REVEAL:`

**User Interaction:** The user can type anything, but as soon as they press the "Enter" key, the transformation sequence begins.

### Phase 2: The Transformation

This is a rapid, fluid animation sequence lasting about 2-3 seconds.

1.  **Fracture:** The "ENTER COMMAND..." line flashes brightly and the entire screen of green text shatters into hundreds of tiny, glowing text fragments.
2.  **Gravity and Reassembly:** These fragments "fall" towards the bottom of the screen, then swirl upwards, coalescing into new shapes. The frantic green text changes color to a clean white and an accent color of electric blue.
3.  **Formation:** The fragments elegantly re-form into the final layout. The background smoothly transitions from the dark charcoal terminal to a deep navy blue gradient with a subtle, slow-moving digital grid pattern. The "hacker" intro is gone, replaced by the portfolio.

### Phase 3: The Main Portfolio Page

**Layout & Style:** A clean, single-page, grid-based layout. The overall feel is minimalist, spacious, and futuristic. The typography is a mix of a sharp monospaced font for headings (like `Fira Code`) and a clean sans-serif for body text (like `Inter`).

**Header Section:**
*   At the top left, the name **Geva Kipper** appears in a large, crisp white monospaced font.
*   Directly below it, in a smaller sans-serif font: "Currently engineering new realities with Google's Core Systems."
*   At the top right, the subtitle is displayed in the electric blue accent color. It has a very subtle, continuous "glitch" effect, where a few letters flicker or shift for a fraction of a second, visually representing the "ever-changing AI" concept:
    `// This site is re-designed daily by AI`

**Project Grid (The Six Boxes):**
The six sections are arranged in a responsive 3x2 grid. Each box is a dark navy card, slightly lighter than the background, with a faint electric blue glowing edge that intensifies on hover.

*   **Resting State:** Each card shows only the project title in the monospaced font (e.g., `'GlglStats'`) and a simple, abstract icon representing the project (e.g., a soundwave for GlglStats, a pin-on-a-map for Ahuzat Dibuk, interlocking polygons for 2D Part Orienting).
*   **Expanded State:** Clicking on a card does not lead to a new page. Instead, the card fluidly expands in-place, pushing the other cards aside. The icon an√≠mates and moves to the side, revealing the project description and links. The card's background shows a faint, blurred, and darkened image related to the project (e.g., a music visualizer, a heatmap, a geometric diagram).

**Content of the Expanded Cards:**

1.  **'GlglStats':** The description appears next to two styled buttons: "Explore The Site" (linking to `glglstats.geekip.dev`) and "Watch PyData Talk" (clicking this opens the YouTube video in a clean, borderless modal overlay).
2.  **'Ahuzat Dibuk':** Description is followed by three distinct, icon-labeled links: "Channel 13 News," "Mako News," and "Original Facebook Post."
3.  **'2D Part Orienting':** Description with a single, prominent button: "View Algorithm & Code".
4.  **'The Turing Jest':** Description with a playful button: "Challenge The LLMs".
5.  **Portfolio Project:** A meta description appears. "The site you are on right now. A self-decrypting, AI-themed portfolio." The link button is styled uniquely with a recursive arrow icon, labeled "You Are Here".
6.  **Contact & Socials Box:** This box doesn't expand. It contains three large, minimalist icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Each icon glows with the blue accent color on hover and links directly to the respective profile.

**Footer:**
At the very bottom of the page, centered and in a small, understated font:

`This design generated by a creative AI assistant.`
`Time since launch: [ 1y 23d 14h 22m 15s ]`

The timer is a live JavaScript counter, ticking upwards in real-time from the specified date and time (2025-07-04 01:09:09), styled in the same monospaced font as the headers.
