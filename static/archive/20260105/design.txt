**Visual Identity & Aesthetic**
The overall aesthetic should mimic a sophisticated, high-end "Dark Mode" software issue tracker or Kanban board (reminiscent of a stylized Linear, Jira, or GitHub Projects). The background should be a deep, matte charcoal (`#0d1117`) to reduce eye strain, with a subtle dot-grid pattern overlay to emphasize precision. Use a monospaced font family (like 'Fira Code' or 'JetBrains Mono') for all text to reinforce the engineering theme. Accent colors should use a syntax-highlighting palette: vibrant neons (cyan, magenta, lime green, and amber) used sparingly for tags, status indicators, and hover states.

**Header Section: "The Dashboard"**
The top of the page acts as the system navigation bar. On the left, a "User Profile" component displays a circular avatar of Geva Kipper with an "Online" green dot indicator. Next to it, clearly display **Geva Kipper** in bold white text, followed by a muted grey pill-badge reading `Role: Software Engineer @ Google`.

Below the name, insert a "System Alert" banner spanning the width. This banner should look like a faint warn-background info box containing the subtitle: *"System Notice: This interface is re-compiled daily by an AI Model. UI is subject to stochastic evolution."*

**Main Content: The "Sprint Board"**
The core content is organized into a responsive masonry grid titled **"Sprint: Deployed Projects"**. The layout should not look like a standard list, but rather like "Ticket Cards" on a board. Each card represents a project and must act as a distinct "Solved Ticket."

**Ticket Card Design System**
Each project box should look like a software ticket with the following elements:
*   **Header:** A unique Ticket ID (e.g., `PROJ-{Number}`) in the top left and a status badge on the top right reading `DEPLOYED` or `RESOLVED` in green text on a dark green background.
*   **Title:** The project name (e.g., 'GlglStats') styled as the ticket subject.
*   **Description:** The project description.
*   **Metadata Footer:** A section at the bottom of the card with small icons representing "Attachments" or "External Links."

**Project Card Specifics:**

1.  **Ticket ID `GLGL-01`: GlglStats**
    *   **Tags:** `Python`, `Audio-Analysis`, `LZ77`.
    *   **Content:** Description of the Israeli pop-chart repetitiveness.
    *   **Action Items (Links):** A primary button labeled "View Deployment" pointing to the GlglStats website, and a secondary media thumbnail labeled "Conference_Talk.mp4" linking to the YouTube PyData video.

2.  **Ticket ID `PARK-TLV`: Ahuzat Dibuk**
    *   **Tags:** `Scraping`, `Data-Viz`, `Public-Service`.
    *   **Content:** Description of the Tel-Aviv parking occupancy heat-maps.
    *   **Action Items (Links):** Create a "Press Coverage" section within the card with links to Channel 13 and Mako. Add a "Source Log" text link pointing to the original Facebook post.

3.  **Ticket ID `GEOM-Cpp`: 2D Part Orienting**
    *   **Tags:** `C++`, `Geometry`, `Algorithms`.
    *   **Content:** Description of the push plan algorithm implementation.
    *   **Action Items (Links):** A button labeled "View Documentation" linking to the project code/info.

4.  **Ticket ID `JEST-AI`: The Turing Jest**
    *   **Tags:** `LLM`, `Gamification`, `Arena`.
    *   **Content:** Description of the pun-making AI competition.
    *   **Action Items (Links):** A distinct "Enter Arena" button linking to the jest website.

5.  **Ticket ID `RHYME-EXT`: Rhymes of Israel**
    *   **Tags:** `Chrome-Ext`, `Generative-AI`, `Humor`.
    *   **Content:** Description of the yearbook-style headline rewriter.
    *   **Action Items (Links):** A generic "Install Plugin" style button linking to the Chrome Web Store.

6.  **Ticket ID `META-WEB`: Portfolio Website**
    *   **Tags:** `Recursive`, `Self-Reference`, `Production`.
    *   **Content:** "This ticket references the container it resides in."
    *   **Action Items (Links):** A link labeled `localhost:remote` pointing to geekip.dev.

**The "Connect" Module**
The 7th box should be styled as a "Team Integrations" panel rather than a ticket. It should feature large, clickable "integration cards" for **GitHub** (Repo icon), **LinkedIn** (Network icon), and **Facebook** (Social icon), arranged horizontally. Each should have a hover effect that makes the icon glow its respective brand color.

**Footer: "System Metrics"**
The bottom of the page should mimic a server status footer.
*   **Left align:** A faint, mono-spaced text reading: *Frontend rendered by [Your Name/AI Identity].*
*   **Right align:** A digital stopwatch component labeled **"UPTIME SINCE EPOCH [2026-01-05 01:18:28]"**. This counter should dynamically tick upwards (or downwards/negative if current date is prior), displaying `HH:MM:SS` in a retro digital clock font (bright red or amber styling).
