# Skill Tree Portfolio Design for Geva Kipper

## Main Concept
A single-page portfolio visualized as an RPG skill tree. The background resembles an ancient parchment map with a subtle grid pattern. As users scroll or navigate, the skill tree comes to life through animations.

## Header
At the top center, large medieval-style text displays "Geva Kipper" with a subtle glow effect. Directly below, a single sentence about his current work at Google in a more modern, clean font.

Below this, a subtitle in italics explaining that the website is re-designed daily by AI and is ever-changing. This text should have a subtle fade-in/fade-out animation to emphasize its transient nature.

## Skill Tree Visualization
The main content area displays a stylized skill tree, where each of the five projects is represented as a "skill node" - hexagonal icons connected by glowing lines that suggest progression paths. 

The skill nodes are arranged in a semi-circular pattern, with small decorative elements like stars or experience points displayed near completed projects. When hovering over connections between nodes, tooltips appear showing the technologies that connect different projects (e.g., "Python," "Data Visualization").

## Project Nodes
Each project node expands when clicked, revealing:
1. Project title in a fantasy RPG font
2. Brief description in a clean, modern font
3. "Stats" displayed as RPG attributes (e.g., Complexity: 85/100, Innovation: 90/100)
4. Relevant links styled as "quest rewards" or "treasure chests"
5. A thematic icon representing each project

## Specific Node Styling
- **GlglStats**: Music note-themed node with waveform animations
- **Ahuzat Dibuk**: Map-themed node with subtle heat-map coloring effects
- **2D Part Orienting**: Geometric-themed node with subtle polygon animations
- **Portfolio Website**: Meta-themed node with recursive design elements
- **Contact Links**: Scroll-themed node with social icons as magical runes

## Interaction
As users hover over each node, it glows and slightly enlarges. When clicked, it expands while other nodes dim slightly. Navigation is possible by clicking nodes directly or using keyboard arrow keys (with visual cues showing which node is selected).

## Footer
At the bottom, elegant text crediting the AI model that created the site, alongside an RPG-styled stopwatch counting time since 2025-04-28 01:05:41, displayed as "Your adventure began XX hours, XX minutes, XX seconds ago."

## Visual Effects
- Subtle particle effects float across the screen like dust motes in ancient library light
- Skill nodes occasionally pulse with soft light to attract attention
- When scrolling between sections, transition effects resemble turning pages in a spell book
- Custom cursor that changes depending on what's being hovered (compass for navigation, magnifying glass for expandable content)

## Accessibility
Despite the creative theme, the site maintains high contrast text, keyboard navigation support, and proper semantic HTML structure for screen readers.
