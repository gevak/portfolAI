### Portfolio Design: The Ever-Changing Notebook

**Overall Concept:** The website is a single, scrollable page designed to look and feel like a developer's interactive workspace or a digital notebook lying on a dark, textured surface like a wooden desk or slate. The entire experience is tactile and responsive, inviting a user to explore rather than just read.

**Initial View & Header:**
Upon loading, the page presents a top-down view of the notebook. The developer's name, "Geva Kipper," is displayed prominently at the top of the "page" in a large, elegant, handwritten script font that looks like fresh ink. Below it, in a clean, smaller, sans-serif font, is the sentence: "A software engineer at Google, crafting innovative projects that blend data, algorithms, and a touch of humor."

Directly under this, a subtitle is rendered in a slightly different, perhaps monospaced or "glitchy" font, stating: "This site is redesigned daily by AI, making it a unique, ever-changing digital canvas." On each page load, this subtitle text animates as if being typed out, and the specific handwritten font for the main title and project titles subtly changes, drawing from a curated set of 3-4 stylish script fonts to fulfill the "ever-changing" promise.

**Project Sections (The Notes):**
The six project sections and the final social links section are not presented in rigid boxes. Instead, they appear as different types of paper notes—sticky notes, torn-out grid paper, index cards, and slightly crumpled lined paper—scattered artfully across the notebook page in a non-uniform, masonry-style grid. This layout is algorithmically generated on page load using the day's date as a seed, so the arrangement of the notes shifts daily.

When a user hovers over a note, it subtly lifts off the page with a soft drop-shadow, and a faint, digital "paper rustle" sound effect can be heard. The notes are interactive elements, not static images.

1.  **GlglStats:** This note is on a piece of graph paper. The title "GlglStats" is handwritten. The description is in a clean, legible font. The links to the website and the YouTube video are not plain text; they appear as if they've been circled with a blue ballpoint pen. Hovering over a circled link causes the circle to glow and the text to become underlined. A small, Polaroid-style photo showing a graph from the project is "paper-clipped" to the corner of this note.

2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk:** This note looks like a yellow legal pad sheet. The title "Ahuzat Dibuk" is scrawled at the top. The links to the news stories and Facebook post are styled to look as if they've been highlighted with a digital yellow marker. The highlight brightens on hover.

3.  **2D Part Orienting:** This note is on a clean, white index card. It features a simple, geometric wireframe diagram of a polygon in the background, faded to not interfere with the text. The title "2D Part Orienting" is written in a precise, architectural-style script. The link to the code is styled like a classic HTML blue hyperlink, but with a monospace font, hinting at its technical nature.

4.  **The Turing Jest:** This appears on a light pink, square sticky note, slightly askew. The title "The Turing Jest" is written in a playful, looping script. The link to the site is styled with a question mark icon next to it, which animates with a little jiggle when hovered over.

5.  **Rhymes of Israel:** This note is styled like a torn piece from a high school yearbook page, complete with a faint, decorative border. The title "Rhymes of Israel" is in a fun, yearbook-style font. The link to the Chrome Web Store is accompanied by a small Chrome logo, and the entire link area appears as a button styled to look like it was cut out and taped onto the note.

6.  **This Portfolio:** The meta project is presented on a small, circular piece of paper, resembling a coaster. It simply has the text "This Notebook," with an arrow icon pointing back at the page URL. The link (https://geekip.dev) is the text itself. Clicking it reloads the page, triggering the new layout animation.

7.  **Contact & Socials:** This is not a single note, but three small, separate sticky tabs (like those used for bookmarking pages) peeking out from the bottom right edge of the main notebook area. One tab has the GitHub icon, one has the LinkedIn icon, and one has the Facebook icon. Clicking a tab smoothly unfurls a small ribbon revealing the full, clickable link.

**Footer:**
At the very bottom of the page, below the notebook area on the dark desk texture, sits the final information. It is rendered in a small, clean, white, monospaced font, as if printed by a label maker.

It reads:

Below this text is a live stopwatch, actively counting up in HH:MM:SS from the timestamp `2025-09-02 01:05:28`. The numbers tick upwards in real-time, providing a dynamic element that reinforces the theme of a constantly evolving digital creation.
