A single-page “Terminal Noir Detective” experience: the page opens like a dark, rain-streaked monitor in a detective’s office—inky charcoal background, subtle film grain, faint scanlines, and a soft vignette. At the top, a glowing monospace “terminal prompt” types in the headline: **Geva Kipper**. Under it, a single sentence in crisp sans/mono mix: “Software engineer at Google, currently building and scaling production systems.” A secondary subtitle sits beneath in a lighter, flickering terminal style: “This portfolio is re-designed each day by AI—an ever-changing case file.” The overall aesthetic blends noir with modern polish: clean spacing, sharp typography, neon-amber highlights, and smooth micro-interactions that feel like reading a dossier, not a typical portfolio.

Navigation is minimal and investigative: a slim “Case Index” strip (sticky, top or left) with items labeled like evidence tags (e.g., **Case 01: GlglStats**, **Case 02: Ahuzat Dibuk**, etc.). Clicking any item scrolls smoothly to its “evidence box,” and each box has a tiny “open file” affordance that expands details in-place—like unfolding a folder. The six/seven sections are presented as **case files** arranged in a responsive grid (2–3 columns on desktop, one column on mobile). Each box looks like a matte-black folder card with a thin glowing border, a stamped case number, and a short “clue line” summary. Hover states feel like investigating: the border brightens, text sharpens, and a faint “typewriter” cursor blinks at the end of the title. The cards animate subtly on scroll (parallax drift, a soft “flashlight sweep” highlight) to reinforce the detective theme without gimmicks.

Each project box is structured consistently: **Title (case name)**, a one-sentence “clue” description, and a compact list of “Evidence” links. For **GlglStats**, the box reads like a forensic audio report: “Python project measuring repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression; visualizes repetition patterns across famous tracks.” Evidence includes a prominent link button to **https://glglstats.geekip.dev** and an embedded video preview tile linking to the PyData TLV talk: **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo** (shown as a “Recorded Interrogation” thumbnail). **Ahuzat Dibuk** appears as a city surveillance file: “Python scraping + visualization of Tel-Aviv parking occupancy, generating resident-friendly heat-maps.” Evidence links are presented as “Press Clippings” (stacked like newspaper strips) pointing to **https://13tv.co.il/item/news/domestic/internal/parking-902956407/** and **https://www.mako.co.il/nexter-news/Article-ae43964b891bf71027.htm**, plus “Original Tip” linking to Facebook: **https://www.facebook.com/groups/secrettelaviv/posts/10159636301195943/**. **2D Part Orienting** is styled as a technical blueprint: “C++ contribution to an open-source computational geometry library implementing an efficient push-plan algorithm to orient a polygon.” Evidence links to **https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/** with a small schematic accent (thin-line polygon/arrow illustration).

The remaining boxes lean into playful noir. **The Turing Jest** is framed as “suspect lineup”: “An LMSYS-like arena where LLMs compete to make and explain puns, rated by users,” with a bold link to **https://jest.geekip.dev** and a small “compare testimonies” UI motif (two columns hinted inside the card). **Rhymes of Israel** reads like an intercepted broadcast: “Chrome extension using an LLM to rewrite Israeli news headlines into comedic rhymes in yearbook style,” with a prominent “Install Evidence” link to **https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eainginjgdkpgolpjniijdihfbeeeklb**. The “meta” portfolio box is the self-referential twist: “This very dossier—an ever-evolving AI-redesigned case file,” with a self-reference link to **https://geekip.dev**, presented like a stamped circular seal (“FILE REFERS TO ITSELF”) but kept tasteful and minimal.

The final box is the “Contacts & Handles” dossier, styled like a desk drawer of IDs: three clean, icon-accented rows with the links **github.com/gevak**, **linkedin.com/in/gevakip**, and **facebook.com/geva.kipper**. This section is intentionally calmer—less animation—so it feels like the conclusive page in the case file. Throughout the page, tiny ambient details reinforce the theme: occasional “log lines” in the margins (e.g., timestamps, short noir snippets like “Clue verified.”), and subtle cursor-like typing when expanding a section, while still preserving readability and elegance.

At the bottom, the footer looks like the terminal signing off: a thin divider line, then a credit line: “Site generated by an AI model (ChatGPT).” Next to it (or aligned right) is a “Stopwatch since incident” display showing live time elapsed since **2025-12-15 01:12:19** in **HH:MM:SS**, styled like a small digital chronometer in monospace with a faint glow. The page ends with a final prompt-like line (non-interactive) suggesting closure—e.g., “case closed // until tomorrow’s redesign”—to reinforce that the AI re-theme happens daily while remaining a single, cohesive scrolling experience.
