The site opens as if the user has just started up an old-school RPG on a Super Nintendo: a pixel-art dark background with subtle parallax star field, faint CRT scanlines overlay, and an 8-bit “boot-up chime” animation that resolves into the main game menu. The navigation follows the visual language of a **retro RPG pause screen**—a windowed pixel menu frame in cool blues and purples, with golden pixel borders and drop shadows, hovering centered on the screen.  

At the very top, large white pixel font displays: **“Geva Kipper”**, with a smaller subtitle line underneath in glowing green text: *“Currently engineering at Google, building large-scale systems with care.”* Just below, another line in flickering typewriter effect: *“This website is redesigned daily by AI — always changing, never the same.”* The entire introduction feels like reading character stats in a JRPG.  

Below the title section, the “Menu” is presented in a classic **command box layout**: six retro-styled window panels, aligned in a 2-column × 3-row grid, each with its own header bar in a darker shade. Each panel opens like a selectable RPG status window when hovered over—expanding with a pixelated “bloop” sound and revealing details.  

1. **GlglStats** – The box shows a pixel-art cassette tape icon. Inside the window: a short description in RPG “quest text” style, a button-styled pixel link to the site (`https://glglstats.geekip.dev`), and a small video embed floating in the lower-right, styled as if it’s displayed on a Game Boy screen. A flashing cursor at the end of the text makes it feel interactive.  

2. **Ahuzat Dibuk** – Icon of a pixel parking meter. The box contains the project description with two “quest scroll” style links to news stories (hyperlinks styled like in-game quest references). The Facebook publication link is styled as a parchment notification pinned to the corner of the box with a tiny pixel thumbtack.  

3. **2D Part Orienting** – Icon is a flat polygon rendered in pixel isometric style. Window describes the project, with a retro "INFO" button that flips the panel to reveal the link (`https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/`). Text styled like RPG item description.  

4. **The Turing Jest** – Icon is a pixel comedy mask with sparkles. The box displays description as if it’s a “battle arena” status screen, with clickable retro-green link to (`https://jest.geekip.dev`). Hover animation causes pixel stars to shimmer around the icon.  

5. **Rhymes of Israel** – Icon is a pixel quill pen over a newspaper. The panel uses a glowing, magical scroll look, with the Chrome extension link framed like an “equippable item” in the RPG UI. A faint rhyme written in playful pixel font auto-animates beneath as flavor text.  

6. **This Portfolio** – Icon: pixel mirror. This box becomes very “meta”: the text window displays *“You are here.”* The link (`https://geekip.dev`) is designed as a selectable “yes/no” dialogue option from RPGs, animating as if it’s prompting whether the player wants to “Re-enter the dungeon.”  

7. **Links / Social** – This final box is styled like a “party members” panel in RPGs. Instead of characters, it lists GitHub, LinkedIn, Facebook, each with an 8-bit icon (sword for GitHub, shield for LinkedIn, heart for Facebook). Clicking a link gives a retro click + glow effect.  

At the bottom of the screen, floating footer styled like a battle HUD: left-aligned, tiny glowing pixel text: *“Designed by GPT-4 — AI Model”*. On the right, a live stopwatch automatically ticks upward in RPG time display (HH:MM:SS), counting from the date `2025-08-21 01:03:22`, styled like a “game clock” during play.  

Overall, the entire design maintains a **retro 16-bit RPG aesthetic** modernized with smooth CSS transitions, glowing neon hover states, and micro-animations that make the site feel like navigating a live-action game menu. It should feel playful yet elegant, celebrating both nostalgia and technical creativity.
