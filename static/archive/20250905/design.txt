### **Website Design: "The Evolving Labyrinth"**

**Overall Concept:**

The website is a single-page, vertical-scrolling experience designed as an interactive, ever-growing timeline. The core visual element is a single, animated line that meanders down the page, representing Geva's professional journey. As the user scrolls, this line "draws" itself into existence, and from it, project sections branch out like nodes on a circuit board or fruits on a vine. The entire visual theme of the site‚Äîthe style of the line, the background, the project boxes, and the color palette‚Äîrandomly regenerates daily, embodying the AI-driven redesign concept.

### **Top-of-Page / Hero Section**

The page opens on a dark, minimalist background. The visual focus is on the top of the animated "timeline," which begins as a single point of light or a small, intricate shape at the center of the screen.

*   **Developer Name:** Directly above this starting point, the name "**Geva Kipper**" is displayed in a large, elegant, and modern sans-serif font.
*   **Job Description:** Immediately below the name, in a smaller, lighter-weight font, is the sentence: "*A software engineer at Google, exploring the intersection of data, algorithms, and creativity.*"
*   **AI Subtitle:** Below the job description, there is a distinct, slightly smaller block of text:
    > "*This portfolio is a living project, algorithmically re-designed each day by an AI. What you see today may be gone tomorrow.*"
    Next to this text is a small, subtly animating icon that changes with the daily theme (e.g., a pulsing neuron, a rotating gear, a shimmering crystal).

As the user begins to scroll, the central timeline element animates downwards, pulling the user's focus into the main content.

### **The Interactive Timeline & Project Boxes**

The timeline is not a straight line but a procedurally generated path that winds its way down the page, with gentle curves, sharp angles, or organic twists depending on the daily theme. The project boxes are attached to this line, appearing on alternating sides (left, right, left, etc.) as the user scrolls down. Each box fades and slides into view as its connecting point on the timeline is reached.

The boxes themselves are not simple rectangles. Their shape and style conform to the daily theme:
*   **Possible Theme 1 (Bio-Mechanical):** The timeline is a bundle of glowing fiber-optic nerves. The boxes are hexagonal plates with glowing edges and circuit-like etchings. The background is a dark, textured carbon fiber.
*   **Possible Theme 2 (Celestial Cartography):** The timeline is a trail of stardust connecting constellations. The boxes are circular "planets" or nebulous clouds of gas that gain clarity on hover. The background is a deep, starry space.
*   **Possible Theme 3 (Architectural Blueprint):** The timeline is a series of clean, dashed architectural lines with 90-degree turns. The boxes are crisp-edged rectangles resembling blueprints, with project titles written in a technical font. The background is textured drafting paper in a dark blue.

**Box Content Layout:**

Upon hovering over a project box, it brightens, and its connecting line to the central timeline pulses with light. The content within each box is organized for clarity and visual appeal:

1.  **Project Title:** Large and bold (e.g., "**GlglStats**").
2.  **Description:** A concise paragraph explaining the project.
3.  **Links:** Presented as a row of stylized icons, not plain text links. On hover, a tooltip reveals the link's destination (e.g., "View on GitHub," "Watch Conference Talk").
    *   **Website/Live Project:** Link icon (üîó)
    *   **Video:** Play button icon (‚ñ∂Ô∏è)
    *   **News Article:** Newspaper icon (üì∞)
    *   **Code/Source:** Code brackets icon (</>)
    *   **Social Media Post:** Facebook/Platform icon (‚ìï)

### **Project Boxes Content:**

1.  **GlglStats:**
    *   Title: **GlglStats**
    *   Description: A Python project that measures the repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression and visualizes repetition patterns in famous tracks.
    *   Icons: Link icon (for glglstats.geekip.dev) and Play icon (for the YouTube video).

2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk:**
    *   Title: **Ahuzat Dibuk**
    *   Description: A Python scraping and data visualization project that collects occupancy statistics for Tel-Aviv parking lots, generating heat-maps for residents.
    *   Icons: Two Newspaper icons (for the 13tv.co.il and mako.co.il articles) and a Facebook icon (for the original post).

3.  **2D Part Orienting:**
    *   Title: **2D Part Orienting**
    *   Description: A C++ implementation of an efficient algorithm for constructing a 'push plan' to orient a given polygon, contributed to an open-source computational geometry library.
    *   Icons: Code brackets icon (for the project/code page).

4.  **The Turing Jest:**
    *   Title: **The Turing Jest**
    *   Description: An LMSYS-style arena where Large Language Models compete at creating and explaining puns, with user-based ratings determining the wittiest AI.
    *   Icons: Link icon (for jest.geekip.dev).

5.  **Rhymes of Israel:**
    *   Title: **Rhymes of Israel**
    *   Description: A Chrome extension leveraging an LLM to humorously rewrite Israeli news headlines into rhyming couplets, in the style of a high school yearbook.
    *   Icons: A Chrome extension puzzle piece icon (for the web store link).

6.  **This Website (Portfolio):**
    *   Title: **The Evolving Labyrinth**
    *   Description: A meta-project; the very portfolio you are viewing. It is built with modern web technologies and features a daily-regenerating design powered by AI.
    *   Icons: A self-referencing "refresh" or "infinity" icon (‚àû) linking to geekip.dev.

7.  **Final Node: Connect**
    *   This last box is styled differently‚Äîperhaps as a terminal point or a central nexus where the timeline terminates. It does not have a title or description. Instead, it features three large, prominent icons for **GitHub**, **LinkedIn**, and **Facebook**, which glow on hover and link directly to the respective profiles.

### **Footer Section**

As the timeline animation concludes, the page settles into a clean footer that is separated from the main content by a thin, glowing line.

*   **AI Credit:** On the left side, a simple line of text: "*This design was generated by Claude, a large language model from Anthropic.*"
*   **Live Stopwatch:** On the right side, a dynamic counter with a clear label. The numbers are displayed in a clean, monospaced font and update every second.
    > *Time Since Genesis: [HH : MM : SS]*
    This timer starts counting up from the fixed date of 2025-09-05 01:02:21. It serves as a final, technical, and intriguing element that grounds the fantastical design in a concrete timeline.
