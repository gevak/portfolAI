# Terminal Hacker Portfolio Design

## Visual Concept

The page opens with a full-screen terminal interface using a dark charcoal background (#0a0e14) with neon green primary text (#00ff41) and cyan accents (#00d9ff). A subtle CRT screen flicker effect and scanline overlay runs across the entire viewport. The cursor is a glowing block that pulses gently. Monospace font throughout (Fira Code or JetBrains Mono) with slight text glow for the cyberpunk aesthetic.

## Entry Sequence

Upon landing, visitors see a boot sequence animation: random hexadecimal values rapidly scrolling, system checks passing with "[OK]" markers, and finally a prompt appears: "UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS DETECTED. IDENTIFY YOURSELF TO PROCEED >>" with a blinking cursor. Visitors must type any character to "bypass" security. After typing, green text streams: "BIOMETRIC SCAN FAILED... ATTEMPTING BACKDOOR... ACCESS GRANTED" followed by ASCII art of a skull made from code characters that glitches and reveals the name "GEVA KIPPER" in large ASCII banner text.

## Header Section

Below the name, a single line in smaller monospace: "Currently optimizing distributed systems at Google" with each letter typing out sequentially. Underneath, in cyan with a slight italic slant: "[NOTICE: This interface is regenerated daily by AI. Each visit may reveal different exploits.]" A blinking "[?]" icon appears that shows this info on hover.

## Project Grid as "System Files"

The six project boxes are styled as terminal windows within the main terminal, appearing as if they're separate "hacked" systems. Each box has a titlebar showing "root@project:~#" followed by the project name. The boxes are arranged in a masonry grid layout that adjusts responsively, creating an asymmetric, dynamic feel.

Each project box features:
- A header line with green text showing the project name preceded by ">> DECRYPTING: "
- A brief description in white/light gray text
- Links styled as clickable file paths (e.g., "/var/www/glglstats" or "/media/demo.mp4") in cyan that glow on hover
- A small "INTEGRITY: 100%" progress bar at the bottom of each box in ASCII characters using brackets and hash symbols [####------]

**Box 1 (GlglStats)**: Features animated equalizer bars made from ASCII pipe characters that bounce to suggest music analysis. Links appear as "→ DEPLOY/https://glglstats.geekip.dev" and "→ FOOTAGE/PyData_TLV_presentation.mp4"

**Box 2 (Ahuzat Dibuk)**: Background shows a faint heat-map gradient in dark reds/oranges behind the text. Links formatted as "→ MEDIA_COVERAGE/channel13.log" and "→ SOURCE/facebook_disclosure.txt"

**Box 3 (2D Part Orienting)**: Subtle rotating polygon wireframe in background made from dots and lines in dark gray. Link as "→ DOCUMENTATION/tau.ac.il/research"

**Box 4 (The Turing Jest)**: Random pun-related symbols (%, !, @) occasionally flicker in the background. Link styled as "→ LAUNCH/jest.geekip.dev"

**Box 5 (Rhymes of Israel)**: Text briefly glitches into rhyming pairs before stabilizing. Link as "→ INSTALL/chrome_webstore.crx"

**Box 6 (Meta Portfolio)**: This box has a recursive effect - a tiny screenshot of the website itself in ASCII art in the background. Link points to "→ RECURSIVE_LOOP/geekip.dev [DANGER]"

## Social Links Section

The final box styled as "EXTERNAL_CONNECTIONS.cfg" with three lines:
```
[GITHUB] -----> github.com/gevak
[LINKEDIN] ---> linkedin.com/in/gevakip  
[FACEBOOK] ---> facebook.com/geva.kipper
```

Each connection has a small icon represented in ASCII art (GitHub's octocat, LinkedIn's "in", Facebook's "f") that glows on hover.

## Footer

At the absolute bottom in small, dimmed text: "SYSTEM_DESIGNED_BY: Claude-3.7-Sonnet | Anthropic_AI_Agent" followed by "UPTIME: [XX:XX:XX]" where the stopwatch actively counts from 2025-11-06 01:07:32, formatted in yellow text with a slight flicker effect to simulate an active system counter.

## Interactive Elements

Random Matrix-style characters occasionally rain down the sides of the viewport at slow speeds. When hovering over any project box, a "ACCESSING..." label appears in the titlebar and the box glows with a cyan outline. All links have a typewriter sound effect on click (optional, can be muted with a small speaker icon in the top-right). The entire page has a subtle vignette effect darkening the edges to focus attention center-screen.
