### Portfolio Design: The Ever-Changing Digital Bookshelf

**Overall Concept & Atmosphere**

The website is a single, full-screen scene depicting a hyper-realistic, slightly stylized digital bookshelf against a dynamic, subtly animated background. The mood is elegant, modern, and intellectual, blending a dark, moody aesthetic with clean, glowing digital accents. The entire color palette, shelf material (e.g., dark oak, brushed metal, polished marble), and background art subtly shift each day, reinforcing the "re-designed by AI" theme. The primary font is a clean, modern sans-serif like Inter or Manrope for readability, while headings use a sophisticated serif for a touch of classic book design.

**The Initial View (Above the Fold)**

Upon loading, the user is presented with the bookshelf as the central element. It's rendered with a slight 3D perspective using CSS, making it feel tangible. Soft, focused lighting from above casts gentle shadows, giving the scene depth.

At the top of the page, floating above the shelf in crisp, white text, is the primary information:

**Geva Kipper**
*[A single sentence, e.g., "A software engineer at Google, focused on developing and scaling large language model infrastructure."]*

Directly beneath, in a smaller, slightly glowing font that hints at its AI origin, is the subtitle:
*This portfolio is re-imagined and re-designed by AI every 24 hours. What you see today may be gone tomorrow.*

On the shelf sit seven items: six distinct "books" and one small, metallic plaque for social links. Each book has a unique cover design that visually represents the project within. They are arranged neatly on the shelf. When a user hovers over a book, it slides forward slightly with a smooth CSS transition, emits a soft, colored glow, and the title on its spine becomes brighter, inviting a click.

**The Books & Their Designs:**

1.  **GlglStats:** The book cover features a design resembling a soundwave or vinyl record groove, subtly morphing into a visual representation of a compressed spring. The spine simply reads "GlglStats."
2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk:** This book has a dark cover overlaid with a luminous, grid-like heatmap pattern in shades of orange and red. A stylized 'P' symbol is embossed in the center. The spine reads "Ahuzat Dibuk."
3.  **2D Part Orienting:** The cover has the appearance of a technical blueprint, with fine white lines on a deep blue background depicting geometric polygons and algorithmic paths. The spine reads "2D Part Orienting."
4.  **The Turing Jest:** The cover is playful, featuring a minimalist jester's hat seamlessly integrated with a glowing question mark. The spine reads "The Turing Jest."
5.  **Rhymes of Israel:** The book's cover looks like a classic newspaper, but some of the headlines are visibly written in a flowing, rhyming script, with a small quill icon at the bottom. The spine reads "Rhymes of Israel."
6.  **The Meta-Portfolio:** This book has a mirrored, highly reflective cover. As the user moves their cursor, a distorted reflection follows. Itâ€™s a literal self-reference. The spine simply bears the URL, "geekip.dev."

**Interaction & Project View**

When a user clicks on a book, a seamless animation transforms the view. The clicked book gracefully levitates and expands to fill the left third of the screen, its cover now clearly visible. Simultaneously, the rest of the bookshelf smoothly fades into the background and blurs, drawing all focus to the selected project.

The right two-thirds of the screen becomes the content area. A clean, semi-transparent card fades in, displaying the project's details with clear typography:

*   **Title:** Large and bold.
*   **Description:** A concise paragraph explaining the project's purpose, technology, and impact.
*   **Actionable Links:** A dedicated section with clean icons and clear text for each link. For example:
    *   (Website Icon) Visit GlglStats Site
    *   (YouTube Icon) Watch the PyData Presentation
    *   (Newspaper Icon) Read the News Story on Mako
    *   (Code Icon) View Project Details & Code
    *   (Chrome Icon) Install from Chrome Web Store
*   For the GlglStats project, the embedded YouTube video would appear directly within this content card for immediate viewing.

To close the project view, the user can either click the book again or a subtle 'X' that appears in the top right corner. The animation reverses, returning the user to the full bookshelf view.

**The Social Links & Footer**

The seventh item on the shelf, at the far right, is not a book but a small, elegant brass plaque. On it are etched three icons: GitHub's Octocat, the LinkedIn 'in' logo, and the Facebook 'f'. Hovering over the plaque makes the icons glow, and clicking each one opens the corresponding profile in a new tab.

At the very bottom of the page is a static, thin footer bar that remains fixed. It contains two elements:

1.  On the left, in small, understated text: `Digital Bookshelf Concept & Design by an OpenAI Assistant.`
2.  On the right, a running digital stopwatch, styled like a classic LCD display. It actively counts up from `2025-08-09 01:08:23`, showing the days, hours, minutes, and seconds passed, labeled "TIME SINCE LAST RE-DESIGN." This reinforces the AI theme with a sense of continuous, ongoing change.
