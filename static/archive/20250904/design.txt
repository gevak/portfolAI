### Overall Concept & User Experience

The website is a single-page, horizontally-scrolling experience. The viewport is treated as a lightbox, and the user "pulls" an endless-feeling strip of film from left to right to view the projects. The entire aesthetic is a modern interpretation of a vintage Kodak filmstrip, with a warm, slightly desaturated color palette, subtle film grain textures, and authentic typographic choices. As the user scrolls, the filmstrip slides horizontally, with each project occupying a distinct "frame." The interaction is smooth and accompanied by subtle animations that enhance the physical feel of moving film.

### The Header (The Film Leader)

The page loads on the very beginning of the filmstrip, designed to look like the "film leader." This initial, non-project section is dark, with markings like "SAFETY FILM" and "GEVA KIPPER" printed vertically along the edge, as if by the manufacturer. The main content of this first view is centered and appears slightly overexposed, as if the film is just starting to be developed. It contains:

*   **Developer's Name:** `Geva Kipper` in a bold, retro-futuristic font, reminiscent of 70s sci-fi movie titles.
*   **Bio:** A single, clean line underneath: `A software engineer at Google exploring the creative intersection of data, algorithms, and language.`
*   **AI Subtitle:** Positioned below the bio, this text has a distinct, slightly "glitched" digital look to contrast with the analog theme: `This site is algorithmically re-designed by an AI daily. Today's iteration is a unique, ephemeral snapshot.`
*   **Call to Action:** A subtle, glowing horizontal arrow icon with the text `Develop Projects â†’` prompts the user to begin scrolling.

### The Filmstrip & Project Frames

As the user scrolls horizontally, the filmstrip moves into view. The strip has visible sprocket holes running along the top and bottom edges. The space between each project "frame" is a solid black vertical bar, just like on real film. Each project frame has a unique, faint color cast (e.g., a warm sepia for 'GlglStats', a cool blue for '2D Part Orienting') as if shot on different film stock.

Hovering over a frame causes it to subtly "brighten" and saturate, as if a projector's light is focusing on it. Links and buttons within the frame have a gentle-glow hover effect.

**1. Project: GlglStats**  
The frame features a background image of a faded audio waveform or a snippet of sheet music.
*   **Title:** 'GlglStats' stamped in a typewriter font.
*   **Description:** A concise paragraph explaining the project.
*   **Links:** Two distinct buttons with clean icons: one with a play symbol for the "Watch PyData Talk" video, and one with a link symbol for "Explore The Site."

**2. Project: Ahuzat Dibuk**  
This frame's background is a stylized, vintage-looking heatmap of Tel-Aviv's streets.
*   **Title:** 'Ahuzat Dibuk' in a stencil font.
*   **Description:** A short explanation of the parking data project.
*   **Links:** Presented as a cluster of three "press clippings," each with a publication logo (13tv.co.il, Mako, Facebook) and a "Read Story" link.

**3. Project: 2D Part Orienting**  
The background is a faint, technical blueprint-style drawing of geometric polygons.
*   **Title:** '2D Part Orienting' in a clean, technical sans-serif font.
*   **Description:** A brief on the C++ and computational geometry work.
*   **Link:** A single, prominent button styled like a lab-tag labeled "View Code & Publication."

**4. Project: The Turing Jest**  
A background of overlapping, semi-transparent comedy/tragedy masks or pun-filled text in a light, script font.
*   **Title:** 'The Turing Jest' in a playful, slightly whimsical serif font.
*   **Description:** Explains the LLM pun arena concept.
*   **Link:** A button that reads "Visit the Arena."

**5. Project: Rhymes of Israel**  
The frame background is a collage of faded, cut-out newspaper headlines.
*   **Title:** 'Rhymes of Israel' in a font that mimics a high-school yearbook's cursive style.
*   **Description:** Details the Chrome extension's rewriting function.
*   **Link:** A button with the Chrome logo that says "Install Extension."

**6. Project: The Portfolio (Meta)**  
This frame is designed to look like a photograph of the filmstrip itself, creating a self-referential, "Droste effect" look. A polaroid photo is laid on top of the filmstrip.
*   **Title:** 'This Website' written in a "handwritten" marker font on the polaroid's white-space.
*   **Description:** A short, meta-text: `This very portfolio. A horizontally-scrolling, AI-generated, film-inspired single-page application.`
*   **Link:** A link stylized as a hand-drawn circle around the text, which reads "View Source (You're Here!)."

### The Final Frame & Footer

The last frame of the filmstrip is the contact section. It is styled to look like the end of a film roll, with a bright orange/red "light leak" effect bleeding in from the right edge.
*   **Title:** `Contact & Connect`
*   **Links:** Instead of buttons, this frame features three large, clean, modern logos for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook. The logos are monochromatic to fit the aesthetic, and clicking on them navigates to the respective profile.

Once the user scrolls past this final frame, the horizontal filmstrip container ends. The page background becomes a simple, dark, static color, and the footer appears centered at the very bottom.

*   **AI Credit:** `This design was generated by Claude, a large language model from Anthropic.`
*   **Live Stopwatch:** Below the credit, a live counter is displayed in a classic, green digital LCD font, creating a final, stark contrast between the analog theme and the digital reality. It's labeled: `Time Since Sept. 4th, 2025 Launch:` followed by the stopwatch, actively counting up in `HH:MM:SS`.
