# Escape Room Portfolio Design

The page opens with a dimly lit, atmospheric scene reminiscent of a detective's office or an escape room lobby. The background features a dark navy-to-black gradient with subtle animated particles that drift like dust in lamplight. At the center, a vintage desk lamp illuminates the name "Geva Kipper" in an elegant serif font with a glowing, warm amber light effect. Below it, a single line in smaller text reads: "Building intelligent systems at Google." Beneath that, in even smaller italicized text with a subtle shimmer animation: "This portfolio redesigns itself daily through AI—you're experiencing today's iteration."

The main interface presents seven locked boxes arranged in a semi-circular pattern, like drawers in an antique cabinet or puzzle boxes on a shelf. Each box has a distinct aged wood or brass texture with an old-fashioned keyhole and a cryptic symbol etched on its surface (geometric patterns, code symbols, musical notes, etc., hinting at the project within). The boxes gently pulse with a faint glow, inviting interaction.

When hovering over a box, it shifts forward slightly, and a riddle or cryptographic clue appears in handwritten script above it. For GlglStats, the clue might be "What song plays on repeat? Find the pattern in the compression." For Ahuzat Dibuk, "Where Tel-Aviv parks its secrets—seek the heat where spaces hide." Each riddle requires the user to click and hold while solving a mini-puzzle overlay.

Upon clicking a box, a translucent overlay slides out like opening a hidden drawer. The puzzle appears as an interactive lock mechanism: for GlglStats, a simple slider-based compression visualization where dragging reveals the answer; for Ahuzat Dibuk, a heat-map pattern that must be clicked in the right sequence; for 2D Part Orienting, a polygon shape that needs rotating to the correct orientation; for The Turing Jest, selecting the funnier of two AI-generated puns; for Rhymes of Israel, rearranging words to create a rhyme; for the meta portfolio box, a mirror-like reflection puzzle; and for the social links box, connecting three nodes in a graph.

Once solved, each box clicks open with a satisfying mechanical sound, and the front panel swings aside to reveal the project details inside. The interior of each box is brightly lit with clean white space, creating dramatic contrast with the dark exterior. Project titles appear in bold, modern sans-serif fonts. Descriptions are concise and scannable. Links are styled as vintage brass buttons or wax-sealed letters that glow on hover. For boxes with multiple links (like Ahuzat Dibuk's news stories), they appear as separate folded notes or tabs. The PyData video link for GlglStats is presented as a film reel icon.

A subtle progress indicator at the top of the page shows seven circles, filling with golden light as each box is unlocked. When all seven are open, a brief congratulatory animation plays—perhaps confetti in code-like characters, or a "Achievement Unlocked" badge appears briefly.

At the bottom footer, in small monospaced font with a terminal-green color: "Escape room designed by Claude (Anthropic) • You've been solving for [dynamic stopwatch: XX hours, XX minutes, XX seconds] since October 27th, 2025." The stopwatch updates in real-time with smooth transitions.

The entire experience is responsive: on mobile, the boxes stack vertically but maintain their locked appearance and puzzle mechanics, with touch-friendly interactions replacing hover states. Smooth CSS transitions and subtle JavaScript animations create a polished, game-like feel throughout without overwhelming the content.
