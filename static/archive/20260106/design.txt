**Visual Concept: The "infinite Build" Character Select Screen**

**General Architecture & Atmosphere**
The site is modeled after a high-end, cyberpunk-fantasy RPG character selection screen. The aesthetic creates a sense of "technological magic." The background is a deep, void-like dark grey (#0a0a12) with a faint, partially rotating wireframe globe or geometric grid floor to give depth. The lighting is dramatic, focusing on the center, while the UI elements float in the foreground using a "Glassmorphism" effect (semi-transparent, blurred backgrounds with neon borders). 

**Center Stage: The Developer Avatar**
In the absolute center stands a digital avatar representing Geva Kipper. Instead of a static photo, this is a stylized, slightly animated cutout or low-poly 3D model of a software engineer (holding a laptop or coffee).
*   **Header:** Above the avatar, large, arcade-style typography reads **"PLAYER: GEVA KIPPER"**.
*   **Tagline:** Directly below the name, a glowing badge reads: *"Class: Software Engineer @ Google"*.
*   **System Message:** Floating casually near the avatar's shoulder is a "glitchy" text bubble or command-line prompt visuals stating: *"Patch v3.0: This layout was procedurally generated by AI today. Tomorrow, it evolves."*

**Left Panel: The "Inventory" (Projects)**
To the left of the avatar is a vertical grid of 6 distinctly icons resembling "Item Slots" or "Equipable Spells." These represent the six projects. They are initially dimmed; hovering over them creates a "highlight" sound effect and glows the border.

1.  **Item 1 (GlglStats):** Icon: An audio waveform inside a compressed cube.
2.  **Item 2 (Ahuzat Dibuk):** Icon: A map pin glowing red (heat map style).
3.  **Item 3 (2D Part Orienting):** Icon: A geometric polygon rotating.
4.  **Item 4 (The Turing Jest):** Icon: A robotic Jester’s cap.
5.  **Item 5 (Rhymes of Israel):** Icon: A chrome quill pen.
6.  **Item 6 (Meta-Portfolio):** Icon: A recursive mirror/infinity symbol.

**Right Panel: Attribute Stats & "Item" Description**
The right side of the screen is the "Stats Board." This is the key interactive element. The top half shows the RPG Attributes, and the bottom half is the Details Window.

*   **The RPG Stats (Dynamic):**
    There are five horizontal progress bars labeled: **COMPRESSION (INT)**, **ALGORITHMS (STR)**, **VISUALIZATION (DEX)**, **NLP/AI (WIS)**, and **HUMOR (CHA)**.
    *   *Default State:* The bars are at a balanced baseline.
    *   *Hover State:* When the user hovers over a project on the left (e.g., 'GlglStats'), the stats dynamically animate. For GlglStats, "COMPRESSION" and "VISUALIZATION" bars fill up to max level, while others drop, simulating equipping gear to boost specific stats.

*   **The Details Window (Dynamic):**
    Below the stats, a holographic card updates based on which project is clicked/hovered. If nothing is selected, it invites the user to "Choose a Quest."
    *   **Slot 1 (GlglStats):** Displays title "GlglStats". Body text: "Python-based LZ77 compression analysis of pop-chart repetitiveness."
        *   Action Buttons: [Deploy Site] (Link to glglstats.geekip.dev) and [Watch Replay] (Link to YouTube PyData).
    *   **Slot 2 (Ahuzat Dibuk):** Displays title "Ahuzat Dibuk". Body text: "Parking occupancy heat-maps via scraping and data viz."
        *   Action Buttons: [Read News Source A], [Read News Source B], [View Facebook Post].
    *   **Slot 3 (2D Part Orienting):** Displays title "2D Part Orienting". Body text: "C++ Computational Geometry algorithm for push-plans."
        *   Action Buttons: [Access Codebase] (Link to cgl.cs.tau.ac.il).
    *   **Slot 4 (The Turing Jest):** Displays title "The Turing Jest". Body text: "LMSYS-style arena for betting on LLM generated puns."
        *   Action Buttons: [Enter Arena] (Link to jest.geekip.dev).
    *   **Slot 5 (Rhymes of Israel):** Displays title "Rhymes of Israel". Body text: "LLM-powered Chrome extension for rewriting news as yearbook rhymes."
        *   Action Buttons: [Install Extension] (Link to Chrome Store).
    *   **Slot 6 (Meta-Portfolio):** Displays title "This Website". Body text: "A self-referential loop. The site you are currently navigating."
        *   Action Buttons: [Refresh Loop] (Link to geekip.dev).

**Bottom Bar: The "Social Party" & System Info**
A fixed footer spans the bottom of the screen, designed to look like the "System HUD" or "Party Members" area.

*   **Social Loadout:** In the bottom center, three circular buttons (like ultimate abilities) house the logos for **GitHub**, **LinkedIn**, and **Facebook**, linking to the respective URLs in a new tab.
*   **Credits & Uptime:** In the bottom right corner, text in a terminal-green monospace font reads:
    *   "Architect: AI Model [Model Name]"
    *   "Server Uptime:" Followed by a digital stopwatch (Hours:Minutes:Seconds) counting upwards relative to the timestamp 2026-01-06 01:13:02. The milliseconds should flicker rapidly to enhance the "active system" feel.

**CSS/Interaction Styling Notes**
*   **Colors:** Cyberpunk palette—Neon Purple, Electric Blue, and Terminal Green against dark matte greys.
*   **Transitions:** All stat changes and text swaps should have a 0.3s ease-in-out transition.
*   **Responsiveness:** On mobile, the layout stacks: Avatar top, "Inventory" grid in the middle, and the "Details/Stats" card appears as a modal overlay when an item is tapped.
