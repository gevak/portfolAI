The visual language of the website is designed to look like a sleek, high-end financial trading terminal (reminiscent of a modern Bloomberg Terminal or Webull dashboard), operating strictly in dark mode. The background is a deep obsidian or charcoal gray (`#0B0E14`), with text rendered in a mix of crisp white and slate gray. Accents heavily utilize "market" colors: neon uptrend green (`#00FF9D`), downtrend crimson (`#FF3366`), and electric blue. Typography is crucial: use a stark, clean sans-serif like 'Inter' for reading text, and a monospace font like 'JetBrains Mono' for all numerical data, tickers, and code references. 

At the very top of the page, pinned to the viewport, is a continuous, animated marquee acting as a stock ticker. Instead of company stocks, it displays a rolling feed of programming skills and technologies with fluctuating "market values" (e.g., `PYTHON ▲+5.4%  |  C++ ▼-0.2%  |  JAVASCRIPT ▲+2.1%  |  LLM INTEGRATION ▲+14.2%  |  COMPUTATIONAL GEOMETRY ▲+8.7%`). 

Below the ticker is the primary header. It features the developer's name, "Geva Kipper," styled like a major market index label, accompanied by a glowing green "MARKET OPEN" online status indicator. Directly underneath is a clean, professional sentence: "Currently engineering scalable solutions and pushing code at Google." Below this sits a slightly glitched, pulsing subtitle styled as a system warning: "NOTICE: This portfolio ecosystem is re-designed daily by AI algorithms; expect high volatility and ever-changing aesthetics."

The core of the single-page layout is a masonry-style CSS Grid resembling a dashboard of asset widgets. Instead of standard portfolio cards, the 7 requested sections are styled as "Asset Holdings" or "Stock Cards." Hovering over any card reveals subtle background animations, like faint candlestick charts or live-updating sparklines. 

**Box 1: Asset GLGL (GlglStats)**
Designed with a vibrant, neon-colored sparkline in the background representing music repetition patterns. The card details a Python project measuring the repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression and visualizing the patterns in famous tracks. The main action button is styled as "Trade Now," linking to `https://glglstats.geekip.dev`. A secondary button, styled as "Play Conference Earnings Call," links to the PyData TLV YouTube presentation (`https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo`).

**Box 2: Asset PRKG (Ahuzat Dibuk)**
This card features an embedded background gradient that shifts from empty green to full red, mimicking a heat-map. It presents a Python scraping and data visualization project collecting Tel-Aviv parking lot occupancy statistics to generate heat-maps for residents. The links are styled as a scrolling list of "Market Press Releases," pointing to the news coverage on 13tv (`https://13tv.co.il/item/news/domestic/internal/parking-902956407/`), Mako (`https://www.mako.co.il/nexter-news/Article-ae43964b891bf71027.htm`), and the original Secret Tel-Aviv Facebook post (`https://www.facebook.com/groups/secrettelaviv/posts/10159636301195943/`).

**Box 3: Asset GEOM (2D Part Orienting)**
Styled with a subtle, wireframe blueprint aesthetic. The text describes a C++ implementation within an open-source computational geometry library, detailing an efficient algorithm for constructing a 'push plan' to orient a given polygon. Upon hover, an animated vector polygon rotates and snaps into place within the card. A "View Technical Prospectus" button links to the code and info at `https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/`.

**Box 4: Asset JEST (The Turing Jest)**
This card has a "Bull vs. Bear" competitive sentiment meter in its UI. It outlines an LMSYS-like arena where LLMs compete at generating and explaining puns, with their answers dynamically rated by users. A bold button labeled "Enter Trading Pit" directs users to `https://jest.geekip.dev`.

**Box 5: Asset RHYM (Rhymes of Israel)**
The UI of this card mimics a live news feed terminal, where serious "headlines" visually morph into comedic text. It describes a Chrome extension that uses an LLM to rewrite Israeli news site headlines into comedic rhymes in the style of a highschool yearbook. A button designated "Acquire Asset" links to the Chrome Web Store (`https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eainginjgdkpgolpjniijdihfbeeeklb`).

**Box 6: Asset META (Portfolio Website)**
A self-referencing card styled with a visual infinity mirror effect or a recursive miniature of the layout itself. The text humorously notes the meta nature of a portfolio website project tracking its own market value. An "Inspect Parent Holding" link directs to `https://geekip.dev`.

**Box 7: Market Makers (Social & Contact)**
Presented as a clean, segmented "Blue-Chip" index board rather than a standard project card. It features three distinct ticker blocks for GitHub (`github.com/gevak`), LinkedIn (`linkedin.com/in/gevakip`), and Facebook (`facebook.com/geva.kipper`), using the respective brands' logos combined with stock arrow icons indicating a continuous upward trend. 

At the bottom of the page sits a sleek, sticky footer bar replicating a terminal command line. Left-aligned text reads: "System Architecture & Daily Re-design computed by AI Assistant (Claude/LLM)." Right-aligned, anchored in bold neon green monospace font, is a dynamic digital stopwatch constantly ticking up (showing Hours, Minutes, Seconds), prefaced by the label: "UPTIME SINCE 2026-02-26 01:26:25".
