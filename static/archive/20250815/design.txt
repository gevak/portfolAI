The portfolio website opens as a small, immersive 3D world rendered in WebGL (Three.js) — a bright, playful, and slightly surreal environment with smooth ambient music and particle effects drifting like digital dust. The user “lands” on a small floating island in a stylized sky. In the center, standing atop a circular stone, hovers **Geva Kipper’s name** in glowing, animated text, along with a one-sentence description: *“Software engineer at Google, crafting intelligent systems and creative tools.”* Below it, slightly smaller in shimmering italic type, the subtitle reads: *“This site is re-designed each day by AI, making it a living, ever-changing experience.”*

From here, navigation feels like a casual mini game: the viewer controls a soft-gliding camera using keyboard arrows or WASD, with gentle acceleration and drift, moving between floating “project islands” arranged in a loose orbit around the center. Each island represents one portfolio item and is themed visually to match the project’s spirit. They gently bob in space alongside stylized clouds, glowing orbs, and animated sky gradients that shift hues over time.

The **GlglStats** island is a stylized floating vinyl record platform. Musical notes float upward like bubbles, and clicking it zooms into an embedded panel with a brief description, clickable link to [glglstats.geekip.dev], and a framed inset for the PyData TLV talk video, which plays on an angled “holographic projector” above the surface.

The **Ahuzat Dibuk** island is shaped like a bright city block at night: glowing parking lot outlines pulse with animated “occupancy heat” textures. Hovering pop-ups offer news story links and the original Facebook post, arranged like neon billboards around the island.

The **2D Part Orienting** island is abstract and geometric: floating polygons rotate slowly above a platform of interlocking triangles. A hovering info pane details the C++ algorithm and links to the TAU project page.

The **The Turing Jest** island resembles a small amphitheater where tiny robot avatars exchange word bubbles containing animated puns. A floating “Enter Arena” button links to [jest.geekip.dev].

The **Rhymes of Israel** island is whimsical: a giant open book hovers above the ground, with colorful rhyme snippets floating out of it. Clicking opens an info card and a large Chrome extension “Install” button.

The **Meta Portfolio** island is an infinity-mirror effect platform where the same 3D world seems to recur into itself when looked at from certain angles. A plaque reads “You are here” with a link to [geekip.dev].

Finally, a **Social Links Dock** floats gently like a sci-fi buoy above the clouds, showing glowing icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook; approaching it causes the icons to expand into linked holographic panels.

At the very bottom of the main island, engraved into a gently rotating stone disk, is an inscription: *“Designed by GPT-4, an AI model.”* Next to it, in an elegant, digital-style font, is a live stopwatch dynamically counting the exact time elapsed since *2025-08-15 01:09:41*, updating every second.

The overall color palette shifts subtly over time to emphasize the “ever-changing” aspect, with lighting and sky shades evolving daily based on a procedural generator. Soft hover sounds, gentle glows, and floating motion cues make the user feel like they’re exploring an artistic, living portfolio world rather than browsing a static page.
