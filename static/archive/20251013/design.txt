# Debugger Interface Portfolio Design

## Core Visual Concept

The entire page resembles a dark-themed IDE debugger interface, specifically mimicking a modern debugging session with a monospace font aesthetic. The background is a deep charcoal (#1e1e1e) with subtle scan-line effects that pulse occasionally. The main header displays "DEBUGGING SESSION: Geva Kipper" in a glowing cyan terminal font, with a blinking cursor. Below it, a single line in amber text reads his current work at Google, formatted as a code comment: `// Currently engineering solutions at Google`. Directly underneath, in a slightly dimmed italic font, appears: `/* Portfolio auto-generated daily by AI - design changes with each compilation */`

## Interactive Bug-Fixing Mechanism

The six project boxes are presented as "ACTIVE BUGS" in a vertical stack, each appearing as a collapsible stack trace or breakpoint panel. Each box has a red "ðŸ”´" bug indicator on the left that turns green "ðŸŸ¢" when clicked/hovered. The boxes are initially in a "collapsed" state showing only:
- A bug ID number (BUG_001 through BUG_006)
- The project name in all caps as if it's a function name
- A one-line "error message" that's actually a teasing description of the project

When visitors click the red bug indicator, the box "expands" with a smooth slide-down animation, revealing the full project details formatted as debug output. The background of the expanded box shifts to a slightly lighter shade with subtle code syntax highlighting colors (strings in green, numbers in orange, etc.).

## Project Box Details

**GlglStats (BUG_001)**: The expanded view shows project details formatted as variable declarations. Links appear as clickable memory addresses in blue: `video_ref: 0x[YouTube URL]` and `live_demo: 0x[glglstats URL]`. A small ASCII waveform visualization animates subtly in the corner.

**Ahuzat Dibuk (BUG_002)**: Details displayed as JSON-like output with nested objects. News links formatted as an array of URLs. A miniature parking grid made of brackets `[ ]` and `[X]` pulses in the margin to represent occupancy.

**2D Part Orienting (BUG_003)**: Presented as C++ style code blocks with the link embedded in a commented `//see implementation at:` line. A rotating wireframe polygon rendered in pure CSS animates in the corner.

**The Turing Jest (BUG_004)**: Formatted as a function call with return values. The link appears as `jest.geekip.dev` in a bright yellow string literal. Small quotation marks blink around it to suggest wordplay.

**Rhymes of Israel (BUG_005)**: Displayed as an extension manifest snippet with the Chrome store link as an "install_url" property. Hebrew characters appear as Unicode escape sequences that subtly shift.

**Portfolio Meta (BUG_006)**: A self-referential infinite loop visualization with the geekip.dev link repeating in smaller and smaller text, creating a tunnel effect.

## Social Links Section (BUG_007)

The seventh box labeled "EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCIES" contains the three social links formatted as import statements: `import profile from 'github.com/gevak'`, `import network from 'linkedin.com/in/gevakip'`, `import social from 'facebook.com/geva.kipper'`. Each has a distinctive icon rendered in ASCII art.

## Footer Elements

At the bottom, in a terminal-style footer bar, the text reads: `Session compiled by: Claude (Anthropic AI Model) | Runtime: ` followed by a live-updating counter showing HH:MM:SS since the specified timestamp. The counter uses a bright green terminal font that flickers occasionally as if processing. A subtle gradient line separates this from the main content, resembling a command prompt separator.

The entire page uses smooth easing transitions when bugs are "fixed" (expanded), with a satisfying click sound effect option. Hover states on clickable elements show them highlighted as if selected in an IDE, with a subtle glow effect.
