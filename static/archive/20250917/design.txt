The website loads with a stark, black screen. A single, pulsing, red letter 'C' is centered, accompanied by a subtle, low-frequency synth hum and the sound of a single mechanical keypress. The 'C' then fluidly animates outwards to spell 'CODEFLIX' in a bold, clean, sans-serif font reminiscent of streaming service logos. The sound fades, and the main interface emerges. The background is a dark, deep charcoal with a very subtle, slowly moving generative art pattern—like a digital nebula or a faint, flowing grid of light—that subtly shifts its color palette and form over time, visually representing the AI's daily redesign.

At the top of the page, the 'CODEFLIX' logo sits in the top-left corner. Centered at the top of the viewport is the main title: "Geva Kipper" in large, luminous white text. Directly beneath it, in a slightly smaller, professional font, is the sentence: "Developing innovative solutions and infrastructure at Google." Below this, a subtitle glows with a faint red aura to draw the eye, stating: "This portfolio is re-designed daily by AI. Its look and feel are ever-changing." The entire header section feels cinematic and sets a premium, high-tech tone.

Below the header, the main content is presented as a single, horizontally-scrolling carousel, exactly like a "continue watching" or "trending" row on a streaming platform. The row is titled "Featured Projects." This row contains seven rectangular tiles, each designed like a high-quality series poster for a streaming show. Each poster has a unique, visually striking graphic that abstractly represents the project, with the project's title overlaid in a bold, stylized font. On mouse hover, each tile smoothly scales up by about 10%. The static poster image crossfades into a silent, auto-playing video loop or animated GIF showcasing the project in action—for 'GlglStats', a visualization of a soundwave morphing; for 'Ahuzat Dibuk', an animating heatmap of Tel-Aviv; for 'The Turing Jest', a rapid-fire display of puns being generated. On hover, two icons also appear over the preview: a classic 'Play' icon and a circular 'More Info' (i) icon.

Clicking the 'Play' icon on a project tile immediately opens the corresponding primary link in a new tab (e.g., the GlglStats website, the YouTube presentation, or the Chrome extension installation page). Clicking the 'More Info' icon triggers a smooth, full-screen modal window that overlays the main page, dimming the background. This modal displays the project's content in detail. A large banner at the top of the modal shows the project's video preview. Below, the content is split into two columns. The left column contains the project title and its detailed description. The right column features a clean, bulleted list of all associated links, each preceded by a distinct icon (a YouTube logo, a newspaper icon, a website link icon, a GitHub Octocat) for quick visual identification. The meta 'Portfolio Website' project tile will humorously link back to the site itself, and its description will briefly explain the 'Codeflix' concept. The final tile in the carousel is minimalistic, titled "Connect", and it displays three stylized icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook, which serve as direct links.

At the very bottom of the single page, separated by a thin, glowing red line, is the footer. On the left side, in small, unobtrusive white text, is the credit: "Design Concept by Claude 3 Opus, an AI by Anthropic." On the right side of the footer, a digital stopwatch is prominently displayed with the label "SYSTEM UPTIME:" followed by a constantly updating timer in a monospaced font, showing the hours, minutes, and seconds that have elapsed since 2025-09-17 01:00:50. This timer reinforces the theme of an ever-running, constantly-evolving system.
