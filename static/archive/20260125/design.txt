**Concept Title:** The Infinite Punch Card Stream
**Visual Theme:** Retro-Futurist Data Processing
**Color Palette:** Deep Void Black (#0a0a0a), Phosphor Green (#00ff41), Paper Cream (#fdfbf7), and Laser Red (#ff0055).

### Global Layout & Atmosphere
The website functions as a mesmerizing "Digital Optical Reader." The background features a subtle, vertically scrolling pattern of punch card rows—hundreds of small, rectangular "chads" (holes). Most are dim gray, but some glow faintly, representing encoded binary data.

A horizontal "Laser Scan Line" is fixed across the center of the viewport. As the user scrolls down, the "paper" moves up. When a content section hits the Scan Line, the punch holes ignite with color, "decoding" instantly into readable text and rich media cards. The aesthetic blends the tactile feel of 1970s IBM computing with modern, high-fidelity glassmorphism.

### Header: The Input Hopper
The top of the page represents the "Feed Mechanism."
*   **Typography:** The name **"Geva Kipper"** appears initially as a pattern of punched holes. As the page loads, the holes fill with white light to form bold, industrial sans-serif letters.
*   **Status Line:** Beneath the name, a blinking terminal cursor types out: *"Software Engineer at Google // System Status: Operational."*
*   **The AI Disclaimer:** Positioned as a floating "metadata tag" near the top right, styled like a code comment: `/* v.2024.x | This interface is hallucinogenic geometry re-generated daily by AI. */`

### The Content Stream (The Six Boxes)
The projects are presented not as static divs, but as "Decoded Sectors." As the user scrolls a project into the Scan Line, the background punch-holes expand and morph into a contained, semi-transparent card (frosted glass effect) with distinct borders.

**1. Project: GlglStats (The Frequency Visualizer)**
*   **Visual:** The card features a background of animated vertical bars mimicking a distinct punch-card audio spectrum.
*   **Content:** A crisp summary of the Python/LZ77 algorithm.
*   **Media:** The PyData conference video is embedded in a CRT-monitor style frame. The link to `glglstats.geekip.dev` acts as a "Execute Program" button.
*   **Detail:** A small data visualization runs in the corner, showing a looped animation of repetition patterns in a pop song.

**2. Project: Ahuzat Dibuk (The Heatmap)**
*   **Visual:** The usually monochrome punch holes in the background of this card shift to a color gradient (Heatmap style: Green to Red) representing parking logic.
*   **Content:** Summary of the Tel-Aviv parking scraper.
*   **Links:** Three distinct "News Ticker" style buttons link to Channel 13, Mako, and the Facebook Secret Tel Aviv post.

**3. Project: 2D Part Orienting (The Geometry Engine)**
*   **Visual:** The card is overlaid with vector wireframes of polygons rotating to align with the grid.
*   **Content:** Description of the C++ computational geometry implementation.
*   **Interaction:** On hover, the cursor becomes a polygon that snaps to a specific orientation.

**4. Project: The Turing Jest (The Arena)**
*   **Visual:** Split-screen duality. The card is divided down the middle, representing two LLMs battling.
*   **Content:** Description of the pun-generation arena.
*   **Action:** A large, glowing "Enter Arena" button linking to `jest.geekip.dev`.
*   **Easter Egg:** A random pun fades in and out in the background of the card.

**5. Project: Rhymes of Israel (The Typewriter)**
*   **Visual:** The font inside this card switches to a comedic, classic newspaper serif.
*   **Content:** Explanation of the Chrome extension.
*   **Action:** The "Install" button is styled like a stylized chrome browser tab.
*   **Animation:** A dummy news headline scrolls across the card, gets "scanned," and rewrites itself into a rhyme in real-time.

**6. Project: Portfolio (The Recursion)**
*   **Visual:** This card is a literal mirror (using a canvas element or CSS reflection) or a "Droste effect" image of the website itself, receding infinitely.
*   **Content:** "Meta-analysis: This website."
*   **Link:** The link to `geekip.dev` pulses like a heartbeat.

### Section 7: The Data Port (Socials)
The stream ends with a "Termination Block."
*   Three large, holographic icons for **GitHub**, **LinkedIn**, and **Facebook**.
*   Instead of standard icons, they are drawn using dot-matrix patterns.
*   Hovering over them creates a magnetic distortion effect on the surrounding punch holes.

### Footer: The Chronometer & Credits
The bottom of the page represents the "End of Tape."
*   **AI Credit:** A small, monospaced stamp: *"Architecture designated by Large Language Model Instance components."*
*   **The Stopwatch:** A prominent, Nixie-tube style digital clock (glowing orange numbers in glass tubes).
*   **The Logic:** It calculates the time delta from **2026-01-25 06:19:51**. Since that date is in the future relative to the design creation, the clock displays a negative countdown labeled **"TIME TO SINGULARITY"** or a positive count labeled **"TEMPORAL DISPLACEMENT"** depending on the current date relative to the target. The milliseconds race vividly to convey precision.
