# Dream Journal Portfolio — Design Description

## Overall Concept & Layout

The entire page is styled to resemble an old, weathered dream journal or diary lying open on a nightstand. The background is a deep indigo-to-midnight-purple gradient that slowly shifts and breathes, with soft, luminous particles drifting upward like embers or floating dandelion seeds. Behind everything, a surreal animated scene plays on loop: enormous translucent jellyfish drift across the sky above a faintly visible upside-down cityscape reflected in water that ripples gently. Occasionally, a slow-motion shooting star traces across the upper portion. The entire background is rendered with subtle CSS animations and layered semi-transparent div elements with animated gradients and blur filters — no canvas or heavy libraries, just pure CSS artistry.

The page has a single-column, vertically scrolling layout with generous whitespace. The "paper" content area is a slightly off-white, parchment-textured column centered on the screen (max-width around 800px), with subtly torn, irregular edges achieved through CSS clip-path or an SVG mask. A faint ruled-line pattern repeats across this parchment background, like actual notebook paper. The left margin has a vertical red line, just like a classic composition notebook. All text sits to the right of this red margin line.

## Typography & Handwriting Feel

The primary body font is a handwriting-style Google Font such as "Caveat" or "Patrick Hand," giving every piece of text the appearance of being personally written in ink. Headings use a slightly bolder, larger version of the same font. Certain keywords and project names are written in a different ink color — a dreamy teal or soft violet — as though the diarist switched pens. Occasionally, words have a subtle wavy underline animation, as if the ink is still wet and shimmering. Small doodles and sketches (rendered as inline SVGs) appear in the margins: a tiny eye, a crescent moon, a spiral, a key, a floating clock — all drawn in a loose, sketchy single-stroke style.

## Header / Introduction

At the very top of the parchment, a date is scrawled in the upper-right corner in smaller handwriting, showing today's actual date dynamically via JavaScript, formatted like "Tuesday, February 11th, 2026" with a small crescent moon drawn beside it. Below that, centered, the name **"Geva Kipper"** is written large and flowing, as if it's the owner's name inscribed on the inside cover of the journal. Beneath the name, in slightly smaller handwriting, a single line reads something like: "Software engineer, currently building things at Google." The word "Google" is written in its four brand colors, letter by letter, but still in the handwriting font, as though someone carefully used colored pens.

Below this, indented like a whispered aside, a subtitle in lighter gray ink and slightly italicized reads: *"This site is reimagined and redesigned each day by AI — no two visits are ever quite the same, like dreams themselves."* A tiny animated infinity symbol or morphing Möbius loop sits beside this line, drawn in a single continuous SVG stroke animation.

## The Six Project Sections (Dream Entries)

Each project is presented as a **dream journal entry**, framed as though the developer dreamed about the project. Each entry begins with a handwritten header like "Dream #1," "Dream #2," etc., with a small sketched icon beside each number. The entries are separated by delicate horizontal dividers — not simple lines, but illustrated elements like a trail of small stars, a vine of flowers, or a winding dotted path, all in SVG.

Each entry box has a very subtle lift/shadow that increases on hover, as though the page is slightly peeling up. On hover, the background of each entry shifts to a slightly warmer cream tone, and the margin doodle near that entry gently animates (a sketched eye blinks, a moon rotates, a clock's hands spin).

**Dream #1 — "The Song That Repeated Itself"** (GlglStats): The entry is written as a dream narrative fragment: the project name "GlglStats" appears as a bold teal header. Below, a description conveys the project in diary-like language — measuring how repetitive Israeli pop songs are using LZ77 compression, and visualizing repetition patterns in famous songs. A small embedded sketch of a looping musical note (SVG, animated to pulse gently) sits in the margin. The YouTube talk link is embedded as a small, styled thumbnail with a hand-drawn play-button triangle overlaid, linking to the PyData TLV presentation. The project site link is styled as a glowing, underlined phrase like *"Enter the dream →"* pointing to glglstats.geekip.dev. Both links use the teal accent color and have a gentle glow on hover.

**Dream #2 — "The Parking Lots That Spoke"** (Ahuzat Dibuk): A dream about parking lots that reveal their secrets. The project name is in violet ink. The description tells of scraping Tel-Aviv parking data and generating heat-maps for residents. In the margin, a tiny sketched car floats upward like a balloon. The three media/news links are presented as small "newspaper clippings" — tiny rectangles with a slightly rotated angle, dotted borders, and the source names (Channel 13, Mako, Facebook) in a serif font, each clickable. They appear like memorabilia taped into the journal.

**Dream #3 — "The Polygon That Found Its Way"** (2D Part Orienting): A dream about shapes being pushed into alignment. The entry describes the C++ implementation of a polygon push-plan algorithm in an open-source computational geometry library. A small animated SVG of a polygon slowly rotating and settling into an orientation plays in the margin. The link to the TAU project page is styled as a footnote reference, like an academic citation the dreamer jotted down.

**Dream #4 — "The Jesters' Arena"** (The Turing Jest): A dream of AI comedians competing on stage. The project name in a playful magenta ink. Description of the LMSYS-style arena where LLMs compete at puns and are rated by users. A small sketched jester's hat with bells animates gently (the bells sway). The link to jest.geekip.dev is styled as a theater ticket stub, slightly rotated, with torn perforated edges.

**Dream #5 — "Headlines Rewritten in Rhyme"** (Rhymes of Israel): A dream where all the news rhymes. Description of the Chrome extension that rewrites Israeli news headlines into comedic yearbook-style rhymes using an LLM. A small quill pen sketched in the margin has ink drops that drip in slow animation. The Chrome Web Store link is presented as a small badge/button resembling the "Available on Chrome Web Store" badge, but hand-drawn in the sketchy style to match the journal aesthetic.

**Dream #6 — "The Dream Within a Dream"** (This Portfolio): This entry is written with self-aware humor — a dream about dreaming about building this very site. The description playfully acknowledges the meta-recursive nature. The margin doodle is a small hand-drawn Droste-effect frame (a picture within a picture within a picture). The link to geekip.dev is styled as a mirror or portal icon with a gentle shimmer animation, as if you could step through it.

## Section 7 — Social Links ("How to Find the Dreamer")

After the last entry, a small centered section appears below a decorative divider of illustrated clouds. The heading says *"Find me outside the dream"* in the handwriting font. Three social icons — GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook — are rendered as hand-drawn sketchy SVG versions of their logos (not the official clean logos, but charming single-line-stroke interpretations). They sit in a horizontal row, each inside a small circular sketched border. On hover, each icon gently floats upward with a soft shadow growing beneath it, as though lifting off the page. Each links to the respective profile URL.

## Footer — AI Credit & Stopwatch

At the very bottom of the parchment, below a final thin vine divider, a small paragraph in lighter, smaller handwriting reads: *"This dream was illustrated by Claude (Anthropic), an AI that doesn't sleep but imagines it can."* The font is slightly more faded, as if written in pencil rather than ink.

Directly below, a live stopwatch is displayed in a monospaced handwriting font (like "Indie Flower" mixed with tabular numbers). It shows elapsed time since February 11, 2026 at 01:49:34 in the format **"XXd XXh XXm XXs"** and updates every second via JavaScript. The stopwatch digits have a very faint trailing afterimage animation (a dreamy ghosting effect using CSS text-shadow with delayed opacity transitions), making the changing numbers feel fluid and surreal rather than mechanical. Above the stopwatch, a tiny label reads *"Time since this dream began:"*

## Animations & Interactions

Throughout the page, subtle parallax scrolling applies: the background jellyfish and particles move at a slower rate than the foreground parchment, creating depth. The parchment itself has a barely perceptible, very slow vertical float (translateY oscillation of 2-3px over 8 seconds), as though the entire journal is hovering slightly above the nightstand.

When the user scrolls, each dream entry fades and slides in gently from slightly below (using Intersection Observer and CSS transitions), as though the words are appearing on the page as you read. The margin doodles for each entry draw themselves in via SVG stroke-dashoffset animation as they enter the viewport.

A small, persistent floating element in the bottom-right corner resembles a sleeping crescent moon with a closed eye. Clicking it toggles between a "night mode" (the default deep indigo surreal background) and a "dawn mode" where the background shifts to soft pinks, pale golds, and wispy cloud animations — as though the dream is transitioning to a waking state. The parchment tint shifts slightly warmer in dawn mode.

## Responsive Behavior

On mobile, the parchment expands to nearly full width with smaller margins. The margin doodles reposition to sit inline above each entry rather than to the side. The background animations reduce in complexity (fewer particles, simpler jellyfish paths) for performance. The torn-edge clip-path simplifies to a subtler treatment. Font sizes scale down gracefully, maintaining the intimate diary feel even on small screens. The social icons stack vertically if needed. The moon toggle button remains accessible in the corner.
