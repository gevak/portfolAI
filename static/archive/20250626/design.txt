### Portfolio Design: "The Career Repository"

**Overall Concept:**

The entire single-page website is styled to mimic a clean, modern interpretation of a GitHub repository page. The layout is minimalist, using a monochrome palette with a single accent color (e.g., a muted teal or electric blue) for interactive elements. The typography is a key feature, using a crisp sans-serif font for body text and a clean monospaced font for headings and UI elements, reinforcing the code-centric theme. The page is divided into a fixed header, a main two-column content area, and a fixed footer.

**Header Section:**

At the very top left of the page, displayed in a monospaced font, is the "repository path": `gevak / career-portfolio`. The text `gevak` is a hyperlink to his GitHub profile. Below this, as the main page title (H1), is the developer's name: **Geva Kipper**, followed by a single sentence: "A Software Engineer at Google, focusing on large-scale systems and data processing."

Directly underneath, a subtle but distinct subtitle reads: `README.md: This site is algorithmically redesigned daily by AI. Last commit: [Current Date]`. This text is styled to look like a file description or a commit message, immediately setting the dynamic and technical tone of the portfolio.

**Main Content a.k.a. "The File Directory & Code Viewer":**

The main body is a two-column layout.

**Left Column (The Commit History):**
This column acts as the primary navigation. It's a vertical list designed to look like a Git commit history. Each of the five sections is an item in this list.

Each item displays:
*   A fake, 7-character commit hash (e.g., `a4e9c6f`).
*   A "commit message" which is the title of the section (e.g., `feat: Implement GlglStats music analysis`).
*   A faint, smaller line below reading `Geva Kipper committed 2 years ago`.

The "commit messages" for the five sections are:
1.  `feat: Implement GlglStats music analysis`
2.  `feat: Scrape and visualize Tel-Aviv parking data`
3.  `refactor: Add 2D Part Orienting algorithm to CGAL`
4.  `docs: Create portfolio README (self-reference)`
5.  `chore: Update contact and social links`

The currently selected item is highlighted with the site's accent color. Clicking on a different "commit" smoothly transitions the content in the right-hand column.

**Right Column (The README.md Viewer):**
This larger column displays the content of the selected "commit" from the left, formatted like a beautiful, rendered README file. It has a slightly off-white background to distinguish it from the page background.

1.  **GlglStats:**
    *   **Heading:** `GlglStats`
    *   **Tags:** Styled "pills" for `Python`, `Data Visualization`, `LZ77`, `Signal Processing`.
    *   **Description:** A concise paragraph explaining the project's goal of measuring song repetitiveness in Israeli pop charts using LZ77 compression and visualizing the patterns.
    *   **Links:** Two prominent, card-like buttons. One with a "Live Site" icon linking to the project, and another with a "YouTube" icon and a thumbnail of the video, linking to the conference presentation.

2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk:**
    *   **Heading:** `Ahuzat Dibuk`
    *   **Tags:** `Python`, `Web Scraping`, `Data Visualization`, `Geo-Data`.
    *   **Description:** A paragraph detailing the project that collects and visualizes occupancy stats for Tel-Aviv parking lots to create useful heatmaps for residents.
    *   **Links:** Three distinct links. Two are styled as "Press Mentions" with the logos of "Channel 13 News" and "Mako", and the third is styled as "Original Publication" with a Facebook icon.

3.  **2D Part Orienting:**
    *   **Heading:** `2D Part Orienting`
    *   **Tags:** `C++`, `Computational Geometry`, `Algorithms`, `Open Source`.
    *   **Description:** A technical paragraph on the C++ implementation of an efficient algorithm for constructing a 'push plan' to orient a polygon, contributed to an open-source library.
    *   **Links:** A single, clean button labeled "View Project & Code," linking to the university project page.

4.  **Portfolio Website:**
    *   **Heading:** `portfolio-dor1`
    *   **Tags:** `JavaScript`, `HTML5`, `CSS`, `AI-Generated`.
    *   **Description:** A short, meta paragraph: "A self-referencing project. This is the portfolio you are currently viewing, designed to emulate a GitHub repository and dynamically updated by an AI to ensure its design is always evolving."
    *   **Links:** A button labeled `View Source (You are here)` which links to the portfolio's own URL, creating a self-reference.

5.  **Contact & Socials:**
    *   **Heading:** `Connect`
    *   **Tags:** `Networking`, `Collaboration`.
    *   **Description:** "Find me on the web. Let's build something great together."
    *   **Links:** Three large, clear icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook, each linking to the respective profile. The icons are minimalistic and glow with the accent color on hover.

**Footer Section:**

The footer is a simple, clean bar at the bottom of the page.
*   **Left Side:** A small, discreet line of text: `Design generated by a GPT-4 model. Version: 2024.05.21`.
*   **Right Side:** A live-updating stopwatch with a monospaced font, prefixed with a label: `Repository Uptime: [HH:MM:SS]`, continuously counting up from `2025-06-26 01:09:14`.
