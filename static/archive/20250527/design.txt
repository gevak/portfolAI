The website presents as a sleek, dark retro arcade cabinet viewed from a slight three-quarter angle perspective. The main screen dominates the center with a subtle CRT monitor glow effect and scan lines overlay. The arcade cabinet frame features brushed metal textures with neon accent lighting in cyan and magenta that subtly pulses.

At the top of the screen, "GEVA KIPPER" appears in chunky, pixelated 8-bit font with a glowing neon outline, followed by his Google work description in smaller retro terminal-style text. Below this, an animated subtitle scrolls horizontally like classic arcade game text: "PORTFOLIO v2.0 - REDESIGNED DAILY BY AI - EVER EVOLVING"

The five project sections are arranged as game selection tiles in a 2x3 grid layout, with the social links section positioned below. Each tile resembles a mini arcade game screen with rounded corners and a subtle drop shadow. When hovering over a tile, it illuminates with colored borders and plays a soft retro beep sound effect.

GlglStats appears as a music rhythm game interface with equalizer bars and waveform visualizations. Ahuzat Dibuk displays as a city-building simulation with pixel art Tel Aviv buildings and animated heat-map overlays. The 2D Part Orienting project shows geometric shapes rotating and aligning like a puzzle game. The meta portfolio section features recursive screens-within-screens with fractal-like borders. The social links section appears as a classic arcade "INSERT COIN" screen with social media icons as coin slots.

Navigation between sections uses retro joystick controls that appear when hovering. Each project section expands smoothly when clicked, revealing project details with typewriter animation effects and retro button styling for external links.

At the bottom, the AI credit appears in small terminal font with a blinking cursor, alongside a digital countdown timer displaying elapsed time since the specified date in classic LCD number styling with a subtle red glow.
