### Visual Identity & Atmosphere within the Browser
**Theme:** "KipperOS v9000 – A Hyper-Modern Glass Ecosystem."
The design acts as a fully immersive, browser-based operating system from the near future. The aesthetic combines **Glassmorphism** (translucent frosted glass panels) with a deep, animated mesh-gradient background that slowly shifts hues between deep indigo, electric violet, and slate grey.

**Cursor & Interaction:** replace the default cursor with a sleek, high-contrast vector arrow. Hovering over any interactive element triggers a subtle "magnetic" effect and a color shift. Background elements respond to mouse movement with a slight parallax depth effect.

### The "Desktop" Layout (The Stage)
The entire viewport is the desktop. Upon loading, there is no scroll bar; instead, the content is contained within distinct "Windows" scattered artistically across the screen space.

**1. The System Status Bar (Header):**
A semi-transparent bar spans the top of the screen.
*   **Top Left:** A terminal-like typing animation cycles through: "System: ONLINE // Designer: AI_Construct // User: Guest".
*   **Top Right:** A live clock in UTC and the battery status of the user’s actual device (using the Battery Status API).
*   **Center:** The "Start Menu" button, designed as a stylized brain icon.

**2. The User Profile Widget (Fixed Window):**
Located in the top-left quadrant is a specialized, non-closeable window resembling an ID card.
*   **Visuals:** A high-res circular avatar of Geva Kipper with a glowing ring indicating "Active Status."
*   **Text:** Large, bold typography reads **"Geva Kipper"**. Below, a status pill glows green with the text: *"Software Engineer at Google"*.
*   **The AI Disclaimer:** Just beneath the role, formatted like a system notification or a warning label: *"NOTICE: This interface is hallucinated and re-designed daily by AI architecture. Stability is not guaranteed."*

### The Project Windows (Draggable Content)
The core content resides in "app windows." Each window features a title bar with Macintosh-style traffic light controls (Close, Minimize, Maximize) and a frosted glass body. These windows are initially tiled neatly but can be dragged, stacked, and resized by the user. The windows have a drop-shadow to create depth (z-index layering).

**Window 1: The Audio Analyzer (GlglStats)**
*   **Icon:** A vinyl record.
*   **Content:** Designed to look like a music player interface. The background of this window features a faint, animated audio waveform.
*   **Body:** A brief synopsis of the LZ77 compression algorithm.
*   **Action:** A large "Play" button that launches the modal video of the PyData presentation. A "Source" button links to the website.
*   **Visual Flair:** When the window is active, the border pulses to a beat.

**Window 2: The Urban Heatmap (Ahuzat Dibuk)**
*   **Icon:** A stylized parking location pin.
*   **Content:** Resembles a GPS navigation dashboard or a radar screen.
*   **Body:** Displays a static heatmap graphic of Tel Aviv. Links to the news stories are styled as "Breaking News" tickers or RSS feed items.
*   **Action:** The link to the Facebook post is styled as a "Community Alert" button.

**Window 3: The Geometric Engine (2D Part Orienting)**
*   **Icon:** A wireframe polygon.
*   **Content:** A minimalist, blueprint-style aesthetic (dark blue background, white lines).
*   **Body:** Abstract geometric shapes rotate slowly in the corner of this window. The text describes the C++ implementation.
*   **Action:** A "Compile Plan" button that acts as the hyperlink to the project page.

**Window 4: The Comedy Arena (The Turing Jest)**
*   **Icon:** A robot jester hat.
*   **Content:** Styled like a retro 8-bit chat interface or a fighting game character select screen.
*   **Body:** Split view showing "Human" vs "LLM" stats.
*   **Action:** A flashing "FIGHT!" button takes the user to `jest.geekip.dev`.

**Window 5: The Rhyme Press (Rhymes of Israel)**
*   **Icon:** A newspaper roll with a chrome logo.
*   **Content:** Styled like a vintage newspaper clipping but with glitch effects.
*   **Body:** The headline typography is Old English font, contrasted with modern Hebrew text examples.
*   **Action:** An "Add to Chrome" badge is prominent at the bottom.

**Window 6: The Recursive Mirror (One Meta Window)**
*   **Icon:** An infinity symbol (∞).
*   **Content:** This window contains an `iframe` or a stylized screenshot of the current website itself, creating a tunnel effect (Droste effect).
*   **Body:** Text reads: *"Recursion depth: 1. You are here."*
*   **Action:** Large button linking to `geekip.dev`.

### The Connectivity Dock (Social Links)
Anchored at the bottom center of the screen is a floating functional dock (resembling macOS). It contains large, bouncing icons for:
*   **GitHub:** Styled as a "Terminal" app icon.
*   **LinkedIn:** Styled as a "Rolodex" or "Contacts" app icon.
*   **Facebook:** Styled as a "Messenger" bubble.
*   **Mail:** A generic envelope icon that triggers a `mailto:` action.

### The Footer / Terminal Console
Anchored to the absolute bottom of the screen is a thin, dark console bar (0.8 opacity black).

*   **Left Side:** A blinking cursor text: *"Code generated by [Your AI Model Name]."*
*   **Right Side (The Chronometer):** A digital stopwatch with a monospace font (e.g., `00:00:00:00`).
*   **Logic:** It calculates the time difference between the current moment and **2026-01-12 01:16:27**. Since this date is in the future, the label should read *"T-Minus until Singularity Event:"* followed by the countdown. If the date has passed, it should read *"Time Elapsed Since Incident:"*. The milliseconds fly by rapidly for visual urgency.
