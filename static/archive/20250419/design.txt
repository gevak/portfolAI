Okay, here is the design description for the AR-enhanced portfolio website:

**Overall Concept:** A clean, minimalist single-page website with a predominantly light background (e.g., off-white or very light grey). The core visual interest comes from subtle animations, clean typography, and the interactive Augmented Reality layer accessible via webcam/phone camera pointed at specific screen elements. The layout feels spacious and modern.

**Header Section:**
*   Top center: "Geva Kipper" in a clear, modern sans-serif font, medium weight.
*   Directly below: A single sentence concisely stating his current role at Google. (e.g., "Software Engineer at Google, focusing on [mention general area if desired, otherwise keep generic]"). Font size slightly smaller than the name.
*   Below the job title: The subtitle "This site's design is regenerated daily by AI, offering a unique experience each visit." in a lighter weight or slightly smaller font, perhaps italicized.
*   Subtle cue for AR: A small, unobtrusive icon (perhaps a stylized camera lens or cube outline) positioned near the header or persistently in a corner. Hovering over it reveals a tooltip like "Activate AR View" or "Point Camera Here". Clicking it could activate the webcam feed overlay or provide brief instructions.

**Main Content - Five Sections Layout:**
Arrange the five sections as clean, outlined boxes or cards with minimal padding and distinct borders (perhaps thin, light grey lines or using subtle background color differences). Consider an asymmetrical grid layout for visual interest – maybe a 2-column layout where the first three projects take up the left column stacked vertically, and the meta-portfolio and social links take up the right column, or a 2x2 grid with the fifth box centered below. The layout itself could be one of the elements subtly altered by the "daily AI redesign" (e.g., changing from a 2+3 vertical split to a 2x2+1 grid).

**Section 1: GlglStats**
*   **Title:** GlglStats
*   **Brief Description:** Python project measuring Israeli pop song repetitiveness using LZ77 compression and visualizing patterns.
*   **Links:** Clearly labeled icons or text links for "Live Site" (linking to `https://glglstats.onrender.com/`) and "Watch PyData Talk" (linking to `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo`).
*   **AR Trigger:** A specific, simple geometric icon integrated within this box (e.g., a stylized sound wave or compression symbol).
*   **AR Effect:** When the camera detects the trigger, a simple 3D visualization related to the project appears floating above the box – perhaps an abstract representation of compression patterns (like shrinking/expanding bars) or a rotating waveform graph. The color or texture of this 3D element could change daily.

**Section 2: Ahuzat Dibuk**
*   **Title:** Ahuzat Dibuk
*   **Brief Description:** Python scraping & data visualization, generating heatmaps of Tel-Aviv parking occupancy for residents.
*   **Links:** Clearly labeled icons or text links for "News: Channel 13", "News: Mako", and "Original Post" linking to the respective URLs.
*   **AR Trigger:** A unique geometric icon (e.g., a stylized map pin or heatmap grid).
*   **AR Effect:** A simplified 3D heatmap layer appears, perhaps overlaid on a faint outline of a city map block, showing shifting colors representing occupancy.

**Section 3: 2D Part Orienting**
*   **Title:** 2D Part Orienting
*   **Brief Description:** C++ implementation of an efficient algorithm for constructing a 'push plan' to orient polygons within a computational geometry library.
*   **Link:** Clearly labeled icon or text link for "Project Details & Code" linking to the CGL TAU page.
*   **AR Trigger:** A unique geometric icon (e.g., a stylized polygon or arrows indicating movement/orientation).
*   **AR Effect:** A simple 3D polygon model appears, slowly rotating or animating through a simplified 'push plan' sequence.

**Section 4: Portfolio Website (Meta)**
*   **Title:** This Portfolio
*   **Brief Description:** A self-referential card detailing the current website, highlighting its daily AI redesign and AR features.
*   **Link:** Clearly labeled icon or text link "View Source/Reference" linking to `https://portfolio-dor1.onrender.com/`.
*   **AR Trigger:** A unique geometric icon (e.g., a recursive symbol or a stylized AI brain/network).
*   **AR Effect:** Perhaps displays floating, abstracted code snippets or shifting geometric patterns representing the AI generation process.

**Section 5: Connect**
*   **Title:** Connect
*   **Content:** Simple, clean icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook, arranged horizontally or vertically. Each icon links directly to the corresponding profile (`github.com/gevak`, `linkedin.com/in/gevakip`, `facebook.com/geva.kipper`). Subtle hover effects on icons. No dedicated AR effect for this section to keep focus on projects.

**Footer Section:**
*   Positioned at the very bottom, centered or left-aligned.
*   Small, unobtrusive text.
*   Line 1: "Website design concept generated by [Your AI Model Name]."
*   Line 2: A live stopwatch displaying "Time since AI genesis: [HH:MM:SS]" dynamically counting up from the specified date and time (2025-04-19 01:01:22).

**Overall Aesthetics & Feel:**
*   **Motion:** Subtle hover effects on boxes (e.g., slight lift or border highlight). The primary motion comes from the AR elements and the stopwatch.
*   **Colors:** Primarily monochromatic (whites, greys) with perhaps one consistent accent color for links or icons. This accent color could be part of the daily AI change.
*   **Fonts:** Legible, modern sans-serif families (like Inter, Montserrat, Lato).
*   **Responsiveness:** The single-page layout should adapt cleanly to different screen sizes, ensuring AR triggers remain identifiable on mobile.
*   **AR Implementation:** Use a JavaScript library like AR.js or MindAR for image tracking triggered by the geometric icons within each project section. The AR effects should be simple WebGL/Three.js models or animations, optimized for performance. The webcam feed could appear as a small overlay window when activated, or the site background could become semi-transparent showing the camera feed behind the content.
