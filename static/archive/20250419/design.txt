# Design Concept: Code That Writes Itself

## Overall Theme
The portfolio website will feature a dynamic code editor that appears to write itself as the visitor scrolls down the page. The background will be a dark code editor theme (dark gray/black) with syntax highlighting in vibrant colors.

## Header
As the visitor first lands on the page, they'll see Geva Kipper's name in a terminal-style font that appears to be typed in real-time with a blinking cursor. Below it, a brief sentence about his work at Google will fade in. The subtitle explaining the AI-redesigned nature of the site will appear as a commented line of code in the self-writing script.

## Scrolling Mechanism
As users scroll down, code will appear to write itself line by line, creating elegant animations, functions, and objects that represent each project. The code won't just be decorativeâ€”it will visually build elements that transform into the actual project showcases.

## Project Sections
Each project will begin as a function declaration in the self-writing code, then "execute" to expand into a full project card. The cards will have a translucent, frosted-glass appearance that contrasts with the dark background.

1. **GlglStats Section**: This will feature a visualization of sound waves that morph into repetition patterns, illustrating the concept of the project. The links will appear as import statements in the code.

2. **Ahuzat Dibuk Section**: Will showcase a subtle animation of a heat-map forming in the background of the card, with data points appearing to gather in real-time. The news links will be represented as API response objects.

3. **2D Part Orienting Section**: Will include an interactive polygon that users can push with their cursor, demonstrating the algorithm's functionality. The project link will appear as a GitHub repository connection in the code.

4. **Portfolio Website Section**: This will be self-referential, with code that appears to generate the very site the user is viewing. A recursive visual effect will make it seem like the site contains smaller versions of itself.

5. **Contact/Social Section**: Social media links will appear as a network diagram being built through code, with nodes representing each platform connecting to a central "Geva" node.

## Interactive Elements
- Cursor interactions will cause ripple effects in the code, as if disturbing the digital fabric of the page.
- Hovering over project cards will highlight the corresponding code segment that "created" them.
- The code will include subtle syntax highlighting that responds to mouse movements.

## Footer
The AI credit will be presented as a console.log statement at the bottom of the code. The stopwatch will look like a running function that updates in real-time, showing elapsed time since the specified date in the format of a continuously incrementing timestamp.

## Responsive Design
On mobile devices, the code writing effect will be condensed but still maintain the core aesthetic, with projects stacking vertically and the code segments adjusting to fit the screen width.

## Navigation
Instead of traditional navigation, a code-folding feature will allow users to collapse and expand sections like in an IDE, enabling quick jumps to different parts of the portfolio.

## Performance Considerations
The animations will be optimized to run smoothly even on lower-end devices, with the option to reduce effects if performance issues are detected.
