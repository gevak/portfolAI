**Visual Concept & Atmosphere**
The website should mimic the interface of a high-tech, cinematic "Mainframe Access Terminal" used by an elite hacker infiltrating a villain's lair. The overall aesthetic is "Cyberpunk Corporate" meets "Unauthorized Root Access."

The background is a deep, void-black canvas (#050505) overlaid with a subtle, slowly rotating 3D wireframe globe or a network topology graph in dim emerald green. A CRT monitor effect (scanlines, slight chromatic aberration, and screen curvature) sits over the entire viewport to give it a hardware feel. All UI elements should appear as "floating" glass panels with frosted transparency (glassmorphism), bordered by thin, neon-bright lines (cyan for stable data, amber for alerts). Mouse movement should drag a "target reticle" cursor, and clicking should produce a mechanical keyboard sound effect. The typography must be purely monospaced (e.g., Fira Code or JetBrains Mono) to reinforce the coding theme.

**Header: The Target Dossier**
At the top left, a "User Identity" block types itself out character-by-character upon load. It displays **Geva Kipper** in large, bold, glitching text (switching randomly between distinct fonts before settling). Below the name, a status indicator pulses green next to the single sentence: "Current Status: Active operative at Google."

To the right of the header, include a scrolling "System Log" ticker (marquee style) styled as warning text. This contains the required subtitle: "WARNING: This interface is re-designed daily by AI. System architecture is polymorphic and ever-changing."

**The Grid: Decrypted Data Nodes (Projects)**
The main content area is an asymmetrical grid of six "Data Modules." Initially, these boxes look like locked, encrypted files (blurred content with a "LOCKED" padlock icon overlay). When the user hovers over a box, a "Decryption sequence" animation plays (random characters rapidly shifting into clear text), the border glows intensely, and the content reveals itself.

*   **Module 1: GlglStats (The Waveform)**
    *   **Visual:** A background displaying a live, animated audio frequency visualizer using the colors of the Israeli flag.
    *   **Content:** Text describing the Python project and LZ77 compression analysis of pop songs.
    *   **Actions:** Two tactical buttons: "Execute Analysis" (Link to site) and "View Surveillance" (Link to YouTube presentation).

*   **Module 2: Ahuzat Dibuk (The Radar)**
    *   **Visual:** A stylized, monochromatic heat map of Tel-Aviv acting as the background, with radar sweeping effects highlighting parking density.
    *   **Content:** Description of the scraping and occupancy visualization for residents.
    *   **Actions:** Three text-link buttons styled as command prompts: "News Report 13," "News Report Mako," and "Original Transmission" (Facebook link).

*   **Module 3: 2D Part Orienting (The Blueprint)**
    *   **Visual:** A wireframe polygon constantly rotating and attempting to fit into a slot, symbolizing the push-plan algorithm.
    *   **Content:** Explanation of the C++ computational geometry implementation.
    *   **Action:** A button labeled "Access Source Code" linking to the project page.

*   **Module 4: The Turing Jest (The Chat Log)**
    *   **Visual:** Split the card background into two halves representing a dialogue interface, mimicking a chat between two AI bots.
    *   **Content:** Description of the LMSYS-like wordplay arena.
    *   **Action:** A prompt blinking "Enter Arena" linking to the site.

*   **Module 5: Rhymes of Israel (The Redaction)**
    *   **Visual:** A background resembling a newspaper page where lines of text are being actively rewritten or highlighted in neon marker ink.
    *   **Content:** Details on the Chrome extension and its yearbook-style rhyme generation.
    *   **Action:** A "download_payload.exe" style button linking to the Chrome Web Store.

*   **Module 6: Meta-Portfolio (The Mirror)**
    *   **Visual:** A "Droste effect" (infinite mirror) image of a terminal window inside a terminal window.
    *   **Content:** "Recursion detected. Self-referential system analysis."
    *   **Action:** A link labeled "Loop origin: geekip.dev" pointing to the main domain.

**The Footer: Communication Uplink & Temporal Data**
Spanning the full width at the bottom is the "Connectivity Bar."

*   **Social Uplinks (Project 7 Integration):** On the left side of the bar, display three high-contrast icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Upon hover, these should expand into "Terminal commands" (e.g., `ssh git@github.com:gevak`, `connect --secure linkedin/gevakip`).
*   **The AI/Time Signature:** On the right side, strictly right-aligned, display the credit: "Punt_Protocol_v4 // Interface generated by AI Model."
*   **The Chronometer:** Next to the credit, a digital stopwatch with monospaced red LEDs counts *upwards*. The label reads "TIME ELAPSED SINCE INCIDENT [2026-01-17 01:10:26]." This implies the website exists in a future timeline, and this counter tracks the duration since the specified date. The milliseconds should race by frantically to add a sense of urgency.
