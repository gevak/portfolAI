# Neural Network Portfolio Design: Geva Kipper

## Overall Concept & Layout

The entire page is a dark canvas (deep navy #0a0f1a) with a living, breathing neural network visualization that spans the full viewport. The network consists of glowing nodes (neurons) connected by pulsing synaptic lines. The background subtly shifts through deep blues and purples, creating an ambient cosmic feel. Particles float gently across the screen like data flowing through a network.

The hero section at the top features "Geva Kipper" rendered in large, light sans-serif typography (Inter or Space Grotesk) with a subtle glow effect. The name itself appears to be constructed from connected neural nodes that animate on load, with each letter forming from converging particle streams. Below it, a clean single line in muted cyan reads his role at Google. Beneath that, in smaller italic text with a soft pulse animation, sits the AI regeneration notice with a subtle infinity symbol icon.

## The Neural Network Structure

Six primary project nodes are arranged in a hexagonal pattern around an invisible center point. Each node is a circular container (approximately 280px diameter) with a glowing border that pulses softly. These nodes are interconnected by animated SVG paths that simulate electrical impulses traveling between them—thin lines with traveling light dots that move along the connections at varying speeds.

When the user hovers over any project node, the synaptic connections leading to and from that node intensify in brightness, and related skill tags (Python, C++, Data Viz, etc.) appear as smaller secondary nodes that fade in along the connection paths, creating a dynamic skill-mapping effect.

## Individual Project Node Design

Each project node has a frosted glass effect (backdrop-filter blur with slight transparency). The interior contains:
- A small iconic symbol at the top (unique per project: musical notes for GlglStats, car icon for Ahuzat Dibuk, geometric shapes for Part Orienting, comedy masks for Turing Jest, news scroll for Rhymes of Israel, recursive brackets for the portfolio)
- Project title in bold white
- Brief description in light gray, compact text
- Links styled as small glowing pills with hover states that cause them to brighten and slightly expand

### Node 1 - GlglStats (Position: Top)
Accent color: Electric purple (#9b59ff). Contains YouTube embed thumbnail that expands into a modal when clicked. The node has subtle waveform patterns in the background representing audio analysis.

### Node 2 - Ahuzat Dibuk (Position: Top-right)
Accent color: Warm orange (#ff8c42). Background contains a faint heat-map pattern. News links displayed with small newspaper icons.

### Node 3 - 2D Part Orienting (Position: Bottom-right)
Accent color: Teal (#00d4aa). Background has faint geometric polygon shapes that slowly rotate. Academic/technical feel with monospace elements for the code link.

### Node 4 - The Turing Jest (Position: Bottom)
Accent color: Bright yellow (#ffd93d). Background has subtle smile/comedy iconography. Playful typography for the title.

### Node 5 - Rhymes of Israel (Position: Bottom-left)
Accent color: Coral pink (#ff6b9d). Background has faint text lines that look like poetry stanzas. Chrome extension link has a small Chrome icon.

### Node 6 - Portfolio Meta (Position: Top-left)
Accent color: Cyan (#00d4ff). Has a recursive visual effect—a tiny representation of the page itself nested within, creating an infinite mirror effect using CSS transforms.

## Social Links Section (Node 7)

Positioned at the center-bottom of the network as a horizontal bar, styled as a command terminal aesthetic with a slight green-on-dark color scheme. Three icons (GitHub, LinkedIn, Facebook) appear as minimalist glowing outlines that fill with color on hover. The bar has a typing cursor animation at one end.

## Footer

A thin, elegant footer strip at the very bottom. Left side shows "Designed by Claude (Anthropic)" in small, humble text with a subtle AI circuit icon. Right side displays the live stopwatch counting up from the specified timestamp, using a monospace font with a soft glow, formatted as "XXh XXm XXs since last generation."

## Interactions & Animations

- On page load, nodes fade in sequentially with a slight scale-up, and connections draw themselves like lightning finding paths
- Cursor creates a subtle gravitational effect on nearby particles
- Clicking empty space causes a ripple of light through the entire network
- Smooth scroll-triggered parallax on the neural connections for depth
- Mobile: Nodes stack vertically, connections become simpler animated lines between adjacent cards
