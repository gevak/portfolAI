The page opens with a **full-browser-width animated pixel-art skyline at night**, shimmering with parallax scrolling layers: distant skyscrapers twinkle, tiny pixelated cars drive by, and a few blinking neon signs light up sporadically. At the highest point of the skyline, hovering over the city, the name **“Geva Kipper”** glows in large pixel-art typography, styled like retro arcade text. Directly under it, in a subtler but equally pixel-styled text, appears the sentence: *“Currently building the future of AI products at Google.”* Beneath that, in smaller italic pixel-text, a subtitle reads: *“This city re-builds itself every day — AI-crafted, ever-changing.”*  

The **scrolling mechanic** is central: as the user scrolls down, the pixel-art **city grows taller and denser**, revealing new neighborhoods, parks, subways, and buildings. Each content section sits **integrated into a new building** in the city’s architecture. Every project is represented as a **pixel-art “window” or rooftop billboard** with vibrant 8-bit details related to the project’s theme. Clicking a project link animates a pixel “elevator” descending into a pop-up window containing the external link or embedded video. Smooth but slightly “choppy” animations emulate retro game feel.

**Section Layout**  
Each of the six main project sections is embedded in its own unique city building:  

1. **GlglStats** – Shown inside a tall recording-studio-like skyscraper with pixel-art sound wave patterns on its facade; a looping pixel visualizer runs in the windows. On click, the PyData TLV talk video plays inside a faux CRT monitor frame right on the building wall. Links appear as glowing “NEON” style buttons labeled “Site” and “Talk.”  

2. **Ahuzat Dibuk** – Presented in a pixel-art multi-story parking garage, with tiny pixel cars driving in and out in loops. Above the building, a pixel sign flashes “Parking Stats.” Clicking it opens an overlay styled like an old parking ticket with the news story links and the original Facebook post.  

3. **2D Part Orienting** – A cleaner, white-and-blue tech tower with rotating pixel polygons on its roof. When hovered, polygon pieces animate into place like puzzle rotations. On click, the CGL website loads into a side “hologram panel” with animated wireframe edges.  

4. **The Turing Jest** – Placed inside a pixel comedy club with a flashing marquee that says “Tonight: LLM PUN SHOWDOWN.” From the tiny club balcony, pixel crowd avatars laugh with animated speech bubbles. Clicking opens the pun arena in a “stage spotlight” modal.  

5. **Rhymes of Israel** – A colorful newspaper-print building with a scrolling news ticker at the bottom, but rewritten into whimsical rhymes in limited pixel fonts. The Chrome Web Store link appears as a floating pixel newspaper that flutters and spins when hovered.  

6. **The Portfolio (Meta)** – This is a sleek city hall building marked “Geekip.dev” in huge glowing pixel letters, with flying digital banners. Meta-reference jokes appear in speech bubbles from pixel tourists outside. Clicking the banner brings you right back to the homepage.  

7. **Social Links** – The scroll ends at the city’s lowest level: an underground subway concourse with tiled walls. Pixel trains labeled “GitHub,” “LinkedIn,” and “Facebook” arrive periodically; each train car is clickable, leading to the corresponding profile.

At the **very bottom** of the page, in the subway’s dim underpass, there’s a small **retro terminal screen** with green text reading: *“This cityscape generated by ChatGPT — forever in motion.”* Next to it, a **pixel stopwatch** ticks dynamically, showing time passed since **2025-08-12 01:08:18** in hours, minutes, and seconds, using monospaced pixel numbers.  

The **overall color palette** is cyberpunk-meets-8-bit-console: deep purples, teals, and neon accents with warm yellow lighting in windows. The scrolling reveals increasingly busy and lively scenes, making the act of navigating the portfolio feel like **exploring a living city**. Each refresh subtly changes building shapes, vehicle patterns, lit windows, and sky details to play into the “AI re-design daily” narrative.

Do you want me to also provide a **scroll-trigger animation plan** so the city expands smoothly without jarring section transitions? That would help ensure the website designer gets the interaction right.
