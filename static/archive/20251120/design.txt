**Visual Aesthetic & Layout Strategy**

The interface simulates a high-fidelity, continuous thermal paper receipt sitting against a dark, sleek charcoal or slate-grey background (`#1a1a1a`). The receipt itself is a long, narrow column centered on the screen, white with a subtle paper texture and a slight drop shadow to create depth. The top edge of the receipt is straight (as if fresh from the roll), while the bottom edge features a randomly generated CSS-driven "jagged tear" pattern.

The topography relies strictly on monospaced fonts (such as `Space Mono`, `VT323`, or `Courier Prime`) to mimic a dot-matrix or thermal printer. The text color is a deep, unsaturated ink-black with slight opacity variations to simulate uneven ink distribution. All imagery (project thumbnails, icons) must be processed through a 1-bit dithering filter (Floyd-Steinberg algorithm) via JavaScript canvas manipulation, turning full-color images into pixelated, black-and-white graphics that look authentically "printed" onto the paper.

**Header & Introduction**

The top of the receipt functions as the header. It features a bold, double-height text logo reading **"GEVA KIPPER"** followed by a standard receipt separator line (e.g., `================================`). Below this, a "Transaction Details" section aligns left and right: "ROLE: SOFTWARE ENGINEER" on the left, and "LOC: GOOGLE HQ" on the right.

Immediately following is the disclaimer, styled as a "Store Policy." It should be boxed in a dashed border reading: *"NOTICE: This interface is re-generated daily by AI. Design subject to algorithmic drift."*

**Project Content (The "Itemized List")**

The body of the receipt treats the six work history items as "Purchased Items." Each section is separated by a single dashed line (`--------------------------------`).

1.  **Item 01: GlglStats**
    *   **Layout:** Displayed as "QTY 1: GLGLSTATS (PYTHON)".
    *   **Visual:** A dithered sparkline graph graphic representing the audio compression data.
    *   **Action:** The links to the site and the PyData YouTube video are styled as "SKU" numbers or a scannable QR code printed next to the text. The YouTube thumbnail is rendered in high-contrast black and white stippling.

2.  **Item 02: Ahuzat Dibuk**
    *   **Layout:** "QTY 1: HEATMAP ANALYTICS".
    *   **Visual:** A pixelated, top-down map icon.
    *   **Action:** The three links (Channel 13, Mako, Facebook) are listed as an indented sub-list, styled like tax breakdowns or modifiers (e.g., " + REF: NEWS_13").

3.  **Item 03: 2D Part Orienting**
    *   **Layout:** "QTY 1: C++ ALGO // GEOMETRY".
    *   **Visual:** A simplified wireframe polygon icon that slowly rotates (using CSS transforms) in a jerky, low-frame-rate stop-motion style to mimic a slow printer update.
    *   **Action:** A bold, underlined "VIEW SOURCE" text links to the project page.

4.  **Item 04: The Turing Jest**
    *   **Layout:** "QTY 1: LLM_ARENA_PUNS".
    *   **Visual:** A duality icon—a robot face and a jester hat—merged and dithered.
    *   **Action:** A "star rating" graphic (5 black stars) sits below the title, with the link to `jest.geekip.dev` styled as a "Customer Survey" code.

5.  **Item 05: Rhymes of Israel**
    *   **Layout:** "QTY 1: CHROME_EXT (COMEDY)".
    *   **Visual:** A stylized newspaper headline icon where the text is illegible blocks.
    *   **Action:** A button styled as a black outlined box with text "INSTALL EXTENSION" links to the Chrome Web Store.

6.  **Item 06: Portfolio (Meta)**
    *   **Layout:** "QTY 1: RECURSION_ERROR".
    *   **Visual:** A Droste effect (picture within a picture) icon of a tiny receipt.
    *   **Action:** The link to `geekip.dev` is labeled "SELF_REFERENCE: TRUE".

**Socials (The "Loyalty Program")**

Near the jagged bottom edge, a section labeled "LOYALTY CONNECT" displays three large, blocky icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook. These should look like stamped ink logos. Below them, the URLs are printed in a smaller, condensed font.

**Footer & Timestamp**

The very bottom of the receipt contains the "Total" section.
*   **AI Credit:** A centered line reading: *"CASHIER ID: AI_MODEL_V1"*.
*   **The Stopwatch:** Styled to look like the timestamp found on every receipt. It should be a monospaced, digital counter `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` format. However, instead of static time, it is a live JavaScript counter calculating the duration from **2025-11-20 01:04:37**.
    *   *Behavior:* If the current date is before the target, it counts down (preceded by "ETA: -"). If after, it counts up (preceded by "T+:"). The seconds flicker slightly to mimic a digital clock refresh rate.

**Interactive Flourishes**
*   **Scroll Animation:** As the user scrolls down, the entire receipt div should have a `transform-origin: top center` with a very subtle 3D perspective swing, making the paper feel like it is hanging and swaying slightly in response to the scroll velocity.
*   **Hover States:** Hovering over any link shouldn't change colors (receipts don't change color). Instead, it should apply a "bold/overstrike" effect, making the text look thicker and darker, as if the printer struck that line twice.
