# Design Concept: Git Timeline Portfolio Website

## Core Concept
A scrollable timeline where the website builds itself through animated git commits. As users scroll down, they witness the website's construction through commit messages, branch merges, and code additions - mimicking the actual development process in a visually engaging way.

## Header
- Minimal fixed header with "Geva Kipper" in a monospaced developer font
- Subtitle: "Software Engineer at Google, building tools that help teams collaborate effectively"
- Secondary subtitle in a slightly muted color: "This portfolio is redesigned daily by AI - what you see today will evolve tomorrow"
- Small animated terminal in the corner showing a git commit being processed

## Timeline Navigation
- A vertical timeline runs down the left side of the page
- Each "commit" along the timeline corresponds to a section of the website
- As users scroll, the timeline highlights the current section with a pulsing dot
- Each dot expands to reveal a mock commit message related to that section

## Sections
Each project section appears as a "commit" to the website, with:
- Commit hash at the top (decorative)
- Animated code blocks that "type out" as you scroll to them
- Split view design: left side shows "code" building the section, right side shows the actual content
- Terminal-style project titles with blinking cursors

### Section 1: GlglStats
- Interactive visualization showing compression of song lyrics
- Code animation shows Python snippets of the LZ77 algorithm
- Embedded video player with custom terminal-styled controls
- Link to live project framed as a "deployment terminal"

### Section 2: Ahuzat Dibuk
- Heat map visualization that builds progressively as you scroll
- Animated data points appearing on a Tel-Aviv map
- News links appear as "git merge" operations from external repositories
- Parking statistics visualized as terminal outputs

### Section 3: 2D Part Orienting
- Interactive geometry animations showing the algorithm in action
- C++ code snippets that build in real-time
- Polygon shapes that rotate and orient themselves based on scroll position
- Link to the project styled as a function call

### Section 4: Portfolio Website
- Meta section that shows the "current commit" being processed
- Self-referential animation that zooms out to show the website building itself
- Terminal window showing the deployment process
- Link styled as a recursive function call

### Section 5: Social Connections
- Social links appear as "remote repositories" being connected
- Each platform icon built using ASCII art initially, then transforming into proper icons
- "git pull" animation when hovering over each link
- Network graph visualization connecting all platforms

## Footer
- Credit line: "Generated by [AI Model Name]" with a small animated neural network icon
- Live stopwatch counting time since May 6, 2025, displayed in terminal format with blinking cursor
- Final commit message: "git push origin main" with animation of code being pushed

## Interactive Elements
- Mouse movement leaves subtle "code trace" effects that fade after a moment
- Clicking anywhere produces a small "commit" effect with random hash
- Scrolling triggers terminal sounds and typing effects
- Dark/light mode toggle styled as "git checkout" between branches

## Color Scheme
- Base: Dark code editor background (#1E1E1E)
- Accents: Git branch colors (main: #4CAF50, feature branches: #2196F3)
- Highlights: Terminal green (#00FF00) for important actions
- Text: Off-white (#F0F0F0) for readability with syntax highlighting for code sections

## Responsiveness
- Mobile view collapses to a more vertical timeline
- Terminal windows become swipeable cards
- Code sections minimize but can be expanded with a tap
- Timeline becomes a progress bar at the top on smaller screens
