# Digital Commit Garden Portfolio - Design Concept

## Overall Theme
The site embodies a "GitHub commit garden" where code contributions grow like plants. The background is a subtle dark gradient (charcoal to deep navy) resembling a night sky, with small particle animations floating like spores or seeds that respond to mouse movement.

## Header
Geva Kipper's name appears in a bold, modern sans-serif font (like Inter or Poppins) with a glowing teal accent, followed by a brief tagline about his current work at Google. The text appears to be "typed" with a blinking cursor animation when the page loads.

Below this, a subtle subtitle in a lighter weight font explains that "This portfolio is reimagined daily by AI, evolving like code itself."

## Navigation
A horizontal navigation resembling git branches extends from the header, with commit-style markers at different points. Each marker pulses softly when hovered.

## Main Content Layout
The five project boxes appear as "commit blocks" in a staggered, asymmetrical grid. Each block has a unique hex-code-like identifier in the corner (mimicking commit hashes). The blocks appear to "grow" into view with a staggered animation as you scroll down.

## Project Blocks Design
Each project block has:
- A top bar with a "commit date" and project name
- An expandable section that grows when clicked (like a git diff view)
- Custom icons representing the technology used (Python, C++, etc.)
- Links that appear as "branch references" with a slight glow effect
- A visual element unique to each project:
  1. **GlglStats**: Animated waveform visualizations with compression patterns
  2. **Ahuzat Dibuk**: Mini heat-map that shifts colors based on time of day
  3. **2D Part Orienting**: Subtle polygon rotation animations in the background
  4. **Portfolio Website**: A recursive miniature of the site itself with meta-references
  5. **Social Links**: Icons that appear as "merge requests" into different platforms

## Interactive Elements
- Mouse hover causes particle "seeds" to gravitate toward projects
- Scrolling triggers growth animations for each section
- When clicking a project, it "commits" forward with a smooth expansion
- Project links emit a "branch" visual when hovered

## Footer
The footer features a terminal-style text displaying the AI creator credit alongside a monospace font stopwatch counting time since the specified date. The stopwatch digits flip with a subtle animation like an old terminal clock.

## Responsive Behavior
On mobile, the "commit garden" transforms into a vertical timeline resembling a git log, with each project as a commit entry that can be tapped to expand.

## Special Touch
A small interactive "contribution graph" in the corner (similar to GitHub's) shows activity over time, but instead of representing actual commits, it's a playful visualization that reacts to visitor interaction, showing how the site evolves with each AI redesign.
