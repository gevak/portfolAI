### **Portfolio Design: "The Geva Kipper Transit Authority"**

**Overall Concept & Initial View:**

The website opens on a dark, deep navy blue background, evoking a sense of calm and depth. Upon loading, animated lines elegantly draw themselves across the screen, forming a stylized, minimalist subway map. The developer's name, **Geva Kipper**, is displayed prominently in the top-left corner in a clean, white, sans-serif font. Directly beneath it, in a slightly smaller and dimmer font, is the sentence: "Currently a Software Engineer at Google, focusing on large-scale systems and machine learning applications."

Below this, a subtitle in a subtle, glowing cyan font reads: "This portfolio is procedurally generated daily by an AI. The layout you see today may be gone tomorrow." The overall aesthetic is clean, modern, and tech-focused, resembling a futuristic public transit interface.

**The Interactive Subway Map:**

The map is the central, interactive element of the page. It consists of three distinct, colored lines, each representing a core area of expertise: a vibrant Python Blue line for data projects, a futuristic Magenta line for AI/LLM projects, and a foundational-looking C++ Orange line for core computer science. The lines are not perfectly straight but have gentle, 45-degree and 90-degree turns, characteristic of classic subway maps.

Each of the seven projects/sections is a "station" on the map, represented by a small, filled circle with a thicker, glowing white outline. Hovering over a station causes it to pulse gently and its name to appear in a clean tooltip above it. The "Social Links" is the final "terminus" station on the Python line, and the "Portfolio Project" is a central "interchange" station where all three lines connect.

**Station Information & Interaction:**

When a user clicks on a station, the map smoothly pans and zooms so the selected station is centered and slightly enlarged. All other parts of the map dim to 50% opacity, focusing the user's attention. Simultaneously, a content panel elegantly slides in from the right side of the screen.

This panel has a semi-transparent, dark background. Inside, the project's title is displayed at the top, followed by a concise description. All links are presented as distinct, clickable buttons with icons: a play icon for the YouTube video, a newspaper icon for news stories, a GitHub icon for code, a web icon for live sites, and an extension icon for the Chrome Web Store. For the 'GlglStats' project, the YouTube video is embedded directly within this panel for instant viewing. Clicking a "close" button (an 'X') in the corner of the panel, or clicking anywhere on the dimmed map, causes the panel to slide away and the map to zoom back to its default overview state.

**The Section Details:**

1.  **GlglStats Station (Python Blue Line):** Displays the project description, a button-link to the site, and an embedded YouTube player for the conference talk.
2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk Station (Python Blue Line):** Shows the project description with three button-links: two for the news stories and one for the original Facebook post.
3.  **2D Part Orienting Station (C++ Orange Line):** Presents the description with a single button-link to the project's academic page and code.
4.  **The Turing Jest Station (AI Magenta Line):** Contains the description and a prominent button-link to the live site.
5.  **Rhymes of Israel Station (AI Magenta Line):** Features the description and a button-link to the Chrome Web Store installation page.
6.  **Portfolio Project Station (Central Interchange):** Shows the description with a button-link pointing to the site's own domain (geekip.dev).
7.  **Contact & Socials Terminus (End of a Line):** This final station's panel contains three large, clearly labeled buttons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook, each with its respective logo.

**Footer & Credits:**

Fixed to the bottom-right corner of the page, in small, unobtrusive white text, is a credit line: "This daily design was generated by Claude 3 Opus." Directly below it is a live stopwatch with a label, continuously ticking upwards: "Time since last redesign: [HH:MM:SS]". The timer begins counting up from the specified date and time of 2025-07-24 01:13:02, reinforcing the site's ever-changing, AI-driven nature.
