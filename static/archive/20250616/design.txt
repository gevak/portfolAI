### Website Design: "The Geva Kipper Protocol"

**Overall Concept & Feel:**
The website is a single, continuous vertical scroll designed to look and feel like an active, elegant command-line interface or a system log. The visitor is not an active participant typing commands, but rather an observer watching a pre-scripted "protocol" execute, which reveals Geva's professional story. The aesthetic is dark, minimalist, and tech-focused, using a monochromatic color scheme with a single, vibrant accent color. The core experience is driven by smooth scroll-based animations where text and content blocks appear as if being "logged" in real-time.

**Initial View (Above the Fold):**
The page loads to a near-black screen (a dark charcoal, not pure black). In the center, a single, thin, blinking cursor in a vibrant electric blue color pulses gently. After a one-second pause, text begins to "type" out character by character next to the cursor:

`> Initializing session for Geva Kipper...`
`> Geva is a Software Engineer at Google, focusing on large-scale infrastructure challenges.`

After this text appears, a new line types out below it:

`> This interface is procedurally redesigned by an AI on a daily basis. All representations are ephemeral.`

Below this, a final line appears with a call to action:

`> Scroll to execute professional story protocol.`

The blinking cursor continues to pulse at the end of this last line, inviting the user to scroll down.

**Scrolling Interaction & Layout:**
As the user scrolls down, the page behaves like a continuous log file. The main "chat" or "log" text appears in a single column, slightly left of center. The five content "boxes" are not literal boxes with borders, but rather clean, structured content blocks that fade into view to the right of the log text as you scroll to the relevant entry.

**Section 1: GlglStats**
As the user scrolls, a new line of log text types itself out on the left:
`> Loading project: GlglStats...`
`> Analysis: A Python project measuring song repetitiveness in Israeli pop charts using LZ77 compression and data visualization.`

Simultaneously, the first content block elegantly fades in on the right. It contains:
-   **Title:** `GlglStats` in a clean, bold sans-serif font.
-   **Links:** Two stylized buttons side-by-side. They are pill-shaped with an electric blue outline and text. On hover, they fill with the blue color and the text turns white.
    -   `[ VIEW LIVE PROJECT ]` (Links to glglstats.onrender.com)
    -   `[ WATCH PYDATA TALK ]` (Links to the YouTube video)

**Section 2: Ahuzat Dibuk**
Scrolling further, new log text appears on the left:
`> Loading project: Ahuzat Dibuk...`
`> Analysis: A Python scraping and visualization tool generating heat-maps of Tel-Aviv parking occupancy. Featured in national news.`

The second content block appears on the right, below the first:
-   **Title:** `Ahuzat Dibuk`
-   **Links:** Three distinct links, each with a small icon (a newspaper icon for news, Facebook icon for the post). The links are plain text in the accent blue color, which underline on hover.
    -   `News Story: Channel 13`
    -   `News Story: Mako`
    -   `Original Facebook Publication`

**Section 3: 2D Part Orienting**
The scroll continues. New log text:
`> Loading project: 2D Part Orienting...`
`> Analysis: A C++ implementation of an efficient computational geometry algorithm for constructing a 'push plan' to orient polygons.`

The third content block fades in:
-   **Title:** `2D Part Orienting`
-   **Link:** A single, prominent button.
    -   `[ EXPLORE ALGORITHM & CODE ]` (Links to the TAU project page)

**Section 4: The Meta Project**
The next log entry appears:
`> Loading project: Recursive Portfolio...`
`> Analysis: This website itself. A self-referential, AI-generated, single-page application serving as a dynamic portfolio.`

The fourth content block appears:
-   **Title:** `This Website`
-   **Link:** A simple, intriguing text link.
    -   `View a static instance of this protocol` (Links to portfolio-dor1.onrender.com)

**Section 5: Contact & Social Links**
The final log entry types out:
`> End of protocol. Establishing connection links...`
`> Standby.`

The fifth and final content block appears. This block has no title. It simply consists of three large, beautifully designed, minimalist icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook. They are rendered in white, but on hover, they are filled with the electric blue accent color and scale up by 10%.

**Footer:**
After scrolling past the final content block, a thin horizontal line of the electric blue color draws itself across the page. Below this line, the footer content is visible, aligned to the bottom corners of the viewport.
-   **Bottom Left:** `Design protocol generated by Claude, an AI by Anthropic.`
-   **Bottom Right:** `System Uptime: [A live stopwatch]` which continuously displays the hours, minutes, and seconds that have passed since the specified date and time, formatted as `HH:MM:SS`. For example: `System Uptime: 3145:18:22`. This reinforces the "live system" theme.
