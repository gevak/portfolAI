# Portfolio Design Concept: "Syntax Illuminations"

## Core Concept
A minimalist dark-themed coding environment where code snippets transform into poetry. As visitors interact with the page, syntax highlighting reveals hidden messages and easter eggs within what appears to be normal code.

## Layout Structure

### Header
- Geva Kipper's name appears as if being typed in a terminal, with a blinking cursor
- Beneath it, a single line describing his work at Google appears with subtle syntax highlighting on key terms
- A floating subtitle that rotates through variations of "This site regenerates daily via AI" with a small visual indicator showing it's version X of Y

### Navigation
- Interactive code brackets `{ }` that expand when hovered to reveal navigation options
- Navigation styled as code comments with syntax highlighting that makes them stand out

### Main Content
The four project sections are displayed as code files in a virtual IDE:

1. **GlglStats.js**
   - Visualized as a JavaScript file with musical notations commented in code
   - Code snippets that, when highlighted, reveal music visualization patterns
   - Links styled as function calls: `openProject("https://glglstats.onrender.com/")`
   - Video embed that looks like a terminal output window

2. **AhuzatDibuk.py**
   - Styled as a Python file with small heat-map visualizations embedded in the code comments
   - News links appear as imported modules in Python syntax
   - Parking statistics visualized through clever use of ASCII art in code comments

3. **Portfolio.html**
   - Meta section that appears to be the actual HTML/CSS that powers the current site
   - Self-referential code that seems to generate itself
   - Link appears as an HTML anchor tag in the code

4. **Contact.json**
   - Social links formatted as a clean JSON object
   - Each link has a small icon that animates when hovered
   - The JSON structure visually completes the portfolio "codebase"

### Interactive Elements
- Mousing over code blocks causes syntax highlighting to shift, revealing hidden messages about Geva's philosophy or humorous comments
- Code folding functionality that reveals additional details about projects
- Subtle line numbers on the left that, when viewed as a pattern, create a minimalist visual design

### Footer
- A terminal-style footer with credit to the AI model
- A monospaced digital stopwatch counting up from the specified date
- Small terminal command prompt suggesting visitors can "type 'help'" for more options (which reveals easter eggs if they actually type it)

### Visual Style
- Dark code editor theme with subtle syntax highlighting in pastel colors
- Custom font that merges coding monospace with subtle readability improvements
- Animated transitions between sections that mimic code compilation or execution
- Background that subtly shifts based on time of day, suggesting an always-evolving codebase

### Responsive Behavior
- On mobile, the interface adapts to look like a mobile code editor app
- Projects can be swiped through like tabs in a mobile IDE
- Menu collapses into a hamburger icon styled as a code commenting symbol
