Full-screen, single-page, scroll-driven experience with a dark, cinematic feel and a living particle field as the core motif. Color palette: near-black background (#05060a), muted off-white text, a single accent color that can change daily (e.g., teal, violet, or amber, chosen each day by AI logic), and subtle neon glows in that accent color.

First viewport (“splash of particles”): The top section fills the screen with a black canvas and a dense spray of tiny, softly glowing particles drifting in 3D. On load, they explode outward from the center, then slowly gravitate into the silhouette of the text “Geva Kipper” (large, minimal sans-serif), then into a second line that reads in one sentence what he currently does at Google (e.g. “Software engineer at Google, building [X]” — shown as regular, left-aligned body text under the name). Beneath this, a smaller subtitle line: “This portfolio is re‑designed each day by AI. Refresh tomorrow for a different layout.” That subtitle has a subtle “data glitch” animation every few seconds to emphasize the ever-changing theme. In the top-right corner, a minimal navigation: “About · Projects · Contact” rendered as small caps; clicking each smoothly scrolls to the respective part of the single page. Background is always the particle canvas, dimmed behind other content as you scroll.

Scroll-triggered particle → résumé morph: As the user starts scrolling, the hero text fades to a low opacity while the particle field transitions: particles loosen from the name outline and swirl downwards, then reassemble as a blocky, rectangular grid that roughly matches the shape of a résumé section (imagine a ghosted wireframe of a CV). At a certain scroll threshold, this particle “résumé silhouette” gently fades out while sharp, readable HTML text fades in on top in the exact same area. That section shows a concise résumé-style summary: name, Google role sentence, a 3–4 line profile/skills summary, and a thin horizontal line acting as a divider. The particle canvas remains behind everything, but its intensity is reduced in this area so text stays fully readable. The accent color highlights labels (e.g., “Experience”, “Projects”, “Contact”).

Daily AI redesign cues: Each new day, different visual parameters are chosen (in implementation) and hinted at visually: the accent color, the shape of the particles (dots vs soft hexagons vs pixel squares), the easing style of the scroll transitions, and the corner rounding of the project boxes (sharp vs pill-shaped). To make this visible in the design, include a very small line under the subtitle reading: “Style of the day: {accent color name}, {particle shape word}, {corner style word}.” This line is right-aligned, slightly lighter, and updates with the day’s style.

Projects grid as morphing boxes: Below the résumé block, a vertical section titled “Selected Work” appears, with six primary project boxes and a seventh “Elsewhere” box for social links. Rather than a static grid, the boxes appear in a staggered, scroll-driven layout: boxes alternate left/right with slight horizontal offset and are connected by a thin, faint vertical line through the center that looks like a timeline. Each box sits on a semi-transparent, glassmorphism-style panel (dark glass with backdrop blur), with a subtle inner glow in the accent color. On hover, small clusters of nearby particles get “attracted” to the box’s border, forming a halo that gently pulses.

1. GlglStats box: Left side, slightly overlapping the central vertical line. Title: “GlglStats” in bold accent color. Subtitle: “Measuring repetitiveness in Israeli pop-chart songs via LZ77 compression.” Below: a 2–3 sentence summary of the Python project, mentioning compression, repetitiveness metrics, and visualizations of repetition patterns in famous songs. Two visually distinct action elements: a pill-shaped button labeled “Explore GlglStats” linking to https://glglstats.geekip.dev, and a secondary outlined button “Watch PyData TLV Talk” linking to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo. To the right of the text, a slim, horizontal “preview bar” shows animated micro-bars that react to mouse hover, evoking music visualization.

2. Ahuzat Dibuk box: Right side, a bit lower. Title: “Ahuzat Dibuk” in accent color. Subtitle: “Parking data scraping and heat-maps for Tel Aviv residents.” Short body copy: explains it’s a Python scraping and data visualization project collecting parking lot occupancy and generating heat maps. Inside the box, a small two-column “Links” row with three mini-buttons: “Channel 13 News Story” (link to https://13tv.co.il/item/news/domestic/internal/parking-902956407/), “Mako Feature” (link to https://www.mako.co.il/nexter-news/Article-ae43964b891bf71027.htm), and “Original Facebook Post” (link to https://www.facebook.com/groups/secrettelaviv/posts/10159636301195943/). Behind this box, a very faint, blurred heat-map-like color gradient echoes the project’s theme.

3. 2D Part Orienting box: Left side, aligned under the previous. Title: “2D Part Orienting” in accent color. Subtitle: “Computational geometry push plans for polygon orientation (C++).” The body mentions it’s an implementation in an open-source computational geometry library of an efficient algorithm for constructing a push plan to orient a given polygon. Include a single main link button labeled “Algorithm & Code” pointing to https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/. Visually, the background of this box features a subtle wireframe polygon diagram: as the user hovers, a small animated line traces a “push plan” path across the polygon outlines.

4. The Turing Jest box: Right side, slightly elevated compared to the next one for a playful feel. Title: “The Turing Jest” in accent color. Subtitle: “LLMs compete to craft and dissect puns; humans rate the punchlines.” Text explains briefly: LMSYS-like arena, LLMs generate puns plus explanations, users vote on funniness and clarity. Single primary button: “Enter the Arena” linking to https://jest.geekip.dev. When hovered, the box’s title gets a tiny “laughter ripple” effect: the letters shift up and down a pixel or two asynchronously for a split-second, like a chuckle.

5. Rhymes of Israel box: Left side. Title: “Rhymes of Israel” in accent color. Subtitle: “Chrome extension that turns Israeli news headlines into yearbook-style rhyming jokes.” Body text: a brief explanation that an LLM rewrites headlines into comedic rhymes. One button: “Install Extension” linking to https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eainginjgdkpgolpjniijdihfbeeeklb. Under the button, include one or two short example “fake” rhymed headlines in a lighter text color, italics, to show tone (no real data needed; keep them generic). As the user hovers, particles behind this card re-arrange into a wave-like pattern traveling from left to right, suggestive of flowing verse.

6. Meta-portfolio box: Right side. Title: “This Portfolio (How Meta)” in accent color. Subtitle: “A living, AI-redesigned single page for showcasing all of this.” Body: a short explanation that this site itself is a project, experimenting with particle morphing, AI-driven daily variations, and scroll-driven narratives. One primary button: “Visit geekip.dev” linking to https://geekip.dev. Inside the box, a smaller label or tag reading “Today’s layout version: {date}” with a very faint “AI-generated” badge. On hover, this box briefly shrinks its padding and then settles back (a micro “breathing” animation) to suggest reflexivity.

7. Elsewhere / Social links box: Full-width, centered near the bottom, but not at the very end (leave space for footer). Title: “Elsewhere on the Web” in accent color, centered. Three large, icon-supported links in a horizontal row on desktop (stacked vertical on mobile): “GitHub” linking to https://github.com/gevak, “LinkedIn” linking to https://linkedin.com/in/gevakip, and “Facebook” linking to https://facebook.com/geva.kipper. Each is rendered as a pill button with the service icon on the left and label on the right. On hover, each pill emits a slight accent-colored glow and pulls a small ring of particles around its perimeter.

Bottom footer with AI credit and stopwatch: The very bottom of the page has a slim, high-contrast footer overlaying the particle background. On the left: a short credit line, e.g. “Layout and concept generated by OpenAI’s ChatGPT.” Under or next to it, a smaller line “Regenerated daily by AI design logic.” On the right: a minimalist digital stopwatch display with monospaced numerals, reading “Time since 2025‑11‑18 01:05:53 (UTC): 0000h 00m 00s” initially. This counter updates every second, counting total hours, minutes, and seconds elapsed since that timestamp. The digits animate with a subtle flip or fade transition when they change, and faint vertical separators between hours/minutes/seconds glow in the accent color. The footer remains fixed only when fully scrolled to bottom; as you approach it, the particles behind gradually dim to almost black, putting focus on the credit and timer.

Responsive behavior: On mobile, the particle canvas remains but density and animation speed reduce for performance. The timeline of project boxes collapses into a single column, with boxes stacked full-width, each separated by generous vertical spacing. Hover effects become tap-based (e.g., first tap reveals extra details, second follows link). The name and subtitle remain large but fit within a single screen height, and the morphing animation still transitions from name → particle field → résumé block on scroll, just in more compact form.

Throughout the page, typography stays clean and modern: a geometric or humanist sans-serif for headings, a highly legible sans-serif for body, and a monospaced font for the stopwatch and any code-like labels. Motion is smooth and understated: easing functions are soft, scroll-driven interactions are progressive (no hard jumps), and particles react gently to pointer movement, creating the feeling of a living, intelligent medium that is continuously reassembling itself into the story of Geva Kipper’s work.
