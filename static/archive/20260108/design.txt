**Visual Style and Atmosphere**
The website is visualized as a vibrant, interactive **Low-Poly 3D "Open Space" Office** rendered in the browser. The aesthetic should utilize a "Solarpunk" or "Clean Tech" color palette—lots of soft whites, pastel blues, warm yellows, and lush low-poly potted plants contrasting with sleek gray hardware. The camera angle is fixed in an **Isometric view**, giving the user a "god-view" of the room. The lighting is soft and ambient with sharp, real-time shadows to emphasize the 3D geometry.

**The Interface (HUD)**
Overlaying the 3D scene is a minimalist, "Glassmorphism" style UI (frosted glass effect).
*   **Top Left:** Displays "Geva Kipper" in a bold, sans-serif font, followed by the single-line bio: "Currently engineering at Google."
*   **Top Right:** A glitch-text subtitle that pulses slightly: "This digital architecture is re-imagined daily by AI. Current iteration: v.2024.X."
*   **Bottom Left:** A small tutorial graphic showing "WASD" keys and "Click to Interact."

**The Character & Navigation**
The user controls a low-poly avatar—a stylized developer character wearing a hoodie and headphones. The character moves smoothly through the office space using keyboard controls. As the character walks, their head turns to look at nearby objects. The floor plan is open, with specific "Stations" representing the portfolio projects. When the character enters the proximity of a Station, a "Press Space or Click" prompt appears floating above the object.

**The Stations (Project Sections)**
Activating a station freezes the 3D movement and zooms the camera slightly toward the object, opening a sleek, semi-transparent overlay box containing the project details.

1.  **Station: The Audio Corner (GlglStats)**
    *   **3D Object:** A large, retro-futuristic jukebox or floor speaker pulsing with light.
    *   **Overlay Content:** A clean layout displaying the title 'GlglStats'. It explains the use of Python and LZ77 compression to analyze Israeli pop music. The overlay includes an embedded version of the PyData TLV YouTube video, a visualization graphic of a song's repetition data, and a prominent "Launch Project" button linking to `glglstats.geekip.dev`.

2.  **Station: The Situation Room (Ahuzat Dibuk)**
    *   **3D Object:** A large table projecting a 3D holographic map of a city with heat patches.
    *   **Overlay Content:** Displays 'Ahuzat Dibuk'. Text describes the scraping of Tel-Aviv parking data and heatmap generation. It features a carousel of thumbnails linking to the news coverage on Channel 13, Mako, and the original Facebook publication. The design uses heat-map color gradients (red to green) as borders.

3.  **Station: The Engineering Desk (2D Part Orienting)**
    *   **3D Object:** A drafting table with a robotic arm continuously rotating a geometric polygon shape.
    *   **Overlay Content:** Title: '2D Part Orienting'. The description highlights the C++ implementation and computational geometry algorithms. A schematic-style background graphic accompanies the text, with a "View Code" button linking to the project page.

4.  **Station: The Comedy Stage (The Turing Jest)**
    *   **3D Object:** A microphone stand on a small raised platform with a spotlight (LMSYS arena style).
    *   **Overlay Content:** Title: 'The Turing Jest'. Text explains the LLM pun competition and user rating system. The background features faint, floating "Ha Ha" text bubbles. A primary button links to `jest.geekip.dev`.

5.  **Station: The Printing Press (Rhymes of Israel)**
    *   **3D Object:** An animated vintage typewriter or a scrolling LED news ticker.
    *   **Overlay Content:** Title: 'Rhymes of Israel'. Describes the Chrome extension that converts news to yearbook-style rhymes. Visuals include a split view of a "Boring Headline" transforming into a "Rhyming Headline." A call-to-action button links to the Chrome Web Store entry.

6.  **Station: The Infinite Mirror (Portfolio Meta)**
    *   **3D Object:** A server rack with a monitor displaying the exact 3D scene the user is currently looking at (a recursive screen effect).
    *   **Overlay Content:** Title: 'Meta-Portfolio'. Playful text explains that this is the site the user is currently visiting. A "Recursion" link points to `geekip.dev`.

7.  **Station: The Social Lounge**
    *   **3D Object:** A coffee break area with a whiteboard and comfortable chairs.
    *   **Overlay Content:** No text description, just three large, animated 3D icons floating in the center of the screen for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook, linking to their respective URLs.

**Footer & Dynamic Footer**
A persistent, thin bar runs across the bottom of the screen.
*   **Center:** Text reads: "Site architecture generated by AI Model [Your Model Name]."
*   **Right:** A digital stopwatch designed like a server uptime counter. It calculates the time delta dynamically. It displays: "Time since Singularity (2026-01-08 01:12:48): [HH:MM:SS]". (Note: Since the date is currently in the future, the design should handle negative numbers or countdown formatting stylistically, perhaps using red LED digits).
