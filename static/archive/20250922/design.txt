Here is the design for a unique, out-of-the-box portfolio website:

### Overall Concept & Ambience

The website is a single, full-screen view of a virtual desk from a top-down, slightly angled perspective. The scene is rendered with a soft, clean, and modern aesthetic, using subtle shadows and lighting to create a sense of depth and realism. The background behind the desk is a soft, out-of-focus blur, hinting at a cozy, minimalist room. The overall feeling is one of organized creativity—a professional's workspace.

Upon loading, the objects on the desk subtly animate into place. A gentle ambient light emanates from an unseen source, casting soft shadows. The central focus is the collection of unique, interactive objects spread across the desk's surface.

### Header & Title Section

-   **Developer's Name & Title:** There is no traditional header. Instead, Geva Kipper's name is professionally displayed on a small, sleek metal nameplate resting on the desk, similar to one found in a modern office. Below his name, on a small, smart-display screen (like a Google Nest Hub), appears the single sentence: "Currently a Software Engineer at Google, working on..."
-   **AI Subtitle:** Next to the smart display is a digital sticky note, rendered to look like an E-ink display. It has a slight flicker animation every few seconds. On it, the text appears in a clean, sans-serif font: "This portfolio is procedurally redesigned by AI every 24 hours. What you see today may be gone tomorrow."

### The Interactive Desk Objects (Project Sections)

The main content is presented not as boxes, but as tangible objects on the desk. When a user hovers over an object, it gains a subtle, warm glow, and a simple, elegant tooltip with the project title appears. Clicking an object triggers a smooth zoom-in animation, where the desk blurs into the background and a modal window elegantly fades in, presenting the detailed project information.

1.  **GlglStats:** Represented by a vintage-style pair of over-ear headphones resting next to an open Moleskine-style notebook. The notebook page is visible, showing a hand-drawn waveform graph titled "Song Repetition Analysis". Clicking on this object (either the headphones or notebook) opens its modal. The modal contains the project description, a prominent button to "Visit GlglStats," and an embedded YouTube player for the conference video.

2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk:** Represented by a folded, stylized map of Tel-Aviv lying on the desk. On top of the map sits a single, minimalist, silver toy car. The map has small, glowing red and green pins on it, visually representing the occupancy heat-map. Clicking the map/car opens a modal with a description and three clearly labeled buttons linking to the 13tv news story, the Mako article, and the original Facebook post.

3.  **2D Part Orienting:** This project is visualized as a set of professional drafting tools: a compass, a protractor, and a t-square, all resting on a sheet of blueprint paper. The blueprint shows the wireframe of a complex polygon with dotted lines and arrows indicating the 'push plan' algorithm. Clicking on the blueprint opens the modal with the project details and a link to the "Code & Info".

4.  **The Turing Jest:** Represented by a small, classic stand-up comedy microphone on a miniature stand. Next to it are two small, theatrical masks—one comedy, one tragedy—symbolizing the rating system. Clicking the microphone brings up the modal with the project description and a button to "Visit The Turing Jest".

5.  **Rhymes of Israel:** Represented by a physical newspaper, folded to show the masthead of a famous Israeli news site. The main headline is visibly crossed out with a casual red marker, and a new, rhyming headline is handwritten above it in a playful, energetic script. Clicking the newspaper opens the modal with the extension description and a clear "Install from Chrome Web Store" button.

6.  **Portfolio Website Project (Meta):** This is represented by a small, elegant, square hand-mirror lying flat on the desk. Its surface is highly reflective. When clicked, instead of a modal, the mirror flashes briefly and the page smoothly scrolls back to the top, reinforcing the self-referential nature of the project. The hover tooltip clearly reads "This Website".

7.  **Social & Contact Links:** A sleek, modern smartphone lies face-up on the corner of the desk. Its screen is dark, but on hover, the screen lights up to show a clean home screen with three large, clickable icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Clicking an icon opens the corresponding link in a new tab.

### Footer & Credits

At the very bottom of the page, seemingly etched into the front edge of the wooden desk, is the credit line and stopwatch. This area is subtle and does not distract from the main scene.

-   **Credit:** "Design by [Your Model Name], an AI."
-   **Stopwatch:** To the right of the credit, a live digital stopwatch is displayed in a classic LCD font, continuously counting up from 2025-09-22 01:08:19, showing HHHH:MM:SS. The numbers tick forward with a smooth, non-jarring animation.
