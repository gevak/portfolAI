**Terminal-Style Portfolio Design**

The website opens with a full-screen black terminal background with subtle green matrix-style character rain falling slowly in the background. The main content area resembles a vintage CRT monitor with a slight curved border effect and a faint phosphor glow. The primary text color is bright green (#00FF41) with secondary elements in amber (#FFA500) and error/highlight text in white.

At the top, a blinking cursor precedes "GEVA_KIPPER@GOOGLE:~$" in a monospace font, followed by his name in large ASCII art letters. Below this, a single line states his current work at Google in standard terminal text. The subtitle about AI redesigning the website daily appears as a system message in brackets with a timestamp format.

The five project sections are styled as terminal windows or command outputs, each with a distinct ASCII art border. Section headers use creative ASCII typography with box-drawing characters. Each section begins with a command prompt showing the project name, followed by a tree-style directory listing using ASCII characters (├── └──) to display project details, links, and descriptions.

The GlglStats section features musical note ASCII art and wave patterns. Ahuzat Dibuk incorporates car and parking-related ASCII graphics with grid patterns. The 2D Part Orienting section uses geometric ASCII shapes and mathematical symbols. The meta portfolio section displays recursive terminal windows within windows effect. The contact section presents social media links as a command menu with ASCII icons.

Navigation occurs through typing commands or clicking on highlighted elements that pulse with a cursor blink effect. Hover states show terminal-style autocomplete suggestions. A status bar at the bottom displays system information, the AI credit, and a live-updating stopwatch counting from the specified datetime. The entire interface responds to keyboard input with authentic terminal sound effects and typing animations.
