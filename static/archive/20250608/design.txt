Upon loading, the user is greeted not by a webpage, but by a clean, simulated desktop environment. The background is a minimalist, abstract generative art piece, composed of slowly drifting geometric shapes and subtle color gradients. A new, unique background is generated every 24 hours. In the center-top of the screen, a small, elegant "Welcome" widget displays the name "Geva Kipper" and underneath, in a slightly smaller font, "Software Engineer at Google, focusing on large-scale data infrastructure." A persistent, semi-transparent menu bar at the very top of the screen contains a single, centered message: "This portfolio's design is regenerated daily by AI."

On the desktop grid, five distinct icons are neatly arranged. They are not traditional skeuomorphic icons, but modern, single-line glyphs. The first four are stylized folder icons, each with a small, unique symbol embedded within: a soundwave for 'GlglStats', a parking sign for 'Ahuzat Dibuk', a polygon for '2D Part Orienting', and a recursive arrow for the 'Meta Portfolio'. The fifth icon is a sleek 'address book' glyph representing social links. The icons have a subtle hover effect, causing them to glow softly and lift slightly from the desktop.

Clicking on any of the four project icons does not scroll the page, but instead spawns a modal window that smoothly animates, scaling up from the icon's position. Each window has a clean title bar with the project's name and functional minimalist controls for 'minimize' and 'close'. The window's content is split into two panes. The left pane contains a concise, one-paragraph description of the project. The right pane is styled to look like a file directory, listing the associated links. Each link is presented with its own icon and a clear label: a globe icon for project sites, a play button for the YouTube video, a newspaper icon for news articles, and the relevant social media logo for social posts. Clicking a link opens it in a new tab.

The 'Social Links' icon opens a smaller, simpler window. Inside, it displays just three oversized, clickable icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook, arranged horizontally with clean typography below each. Users can open multiple windows at once, drag them around the screen, and 'minimize' them, which shrinks the window into a small tab on the taskbar at the bottom of the screen, allowing for it to be restored with a click. Closing a window causes it to fade and shrink back towards its original desktop icon.

A sleek, full-width taskbar is fixed to the bottom of the screen, featuring a blurred glassmorphism effect that subtly shows the generative art background behind it. On the far left of this taskbar, a credit reads: "Site architecture and design by ChatGPT." On the far right, a live, ticking stopwatch is displayed under the label "System Uptime," actively counting the hours, minutes, and seconds that have elapsed since 01:15:07 on June 8th, 2025, reinforcing the continuous, "always-on" nature of the simulated OS.
