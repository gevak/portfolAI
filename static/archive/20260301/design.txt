**Overall Concept & Visual Architecture**
The website is structured as a vertical scroll that creates an illusion of forward movement through a dimly lit, modern 3D museum corridor. The overall color palette is a deep, atmospheric dark void (e.g., `#050508`) with subtle, frosted floor reflections. Interactions are driven by CSS 3D transforms (`perspective`, `rotateY`, `rotateX`, `translateZ`) tied to the user’s scroll position. As the user scrolls down, they "walk" past glowing digital pedestals positioned along the left and right sides of the screen. Above each pedestal floats a glassmorphic "hologram" card containing the project details. Typography should be a sleek, geometric sans-serif (like 'Space Grotesk') paired with a technical monospace font for subtitles and links.

**The Foyer (Hero Section)**
The immediate landing view acts as the museum entrance. Centered on the screen is a large, elegant title reading "Geva Kipper", illuminated by a soft, pulsating back-glow (box-shadow). Below it, in crisp, minimalist text: "Currently building and engineering solutions at Google." 
Directly beneath this is the AI subtitle. To emphasize the ever-changing nature of the text, use an ethereal, slightly glitchy or fading CSS animation that reads: "This digital gallery is re-designed each day by AI and is endlessly ever-changing." Wait a moment before the user is prompted to "Scroll to Enter," initiating the forward-movement parallax effect into the gallery.

**The Hologram Pedestals (Projects 1-6)**
Each project is presented as a holographic display floating above a minimalist metallic base. The "holograms" are translucent, frosted-glass CSS panels with semi-transparent borders and individual neon drop-shadow glows. By default, they are angled in 3D space (leaning slightly toward the center walkway). When the user hovers over a display, it smoothly rotates to face the user flat-on, and the glow intensifies.

*   **Exhibit 1: GlglStats**
    *   *Visuals:* A cyan-glowing hologram. The background of the card features a faint, looping CSS animation of expanding and collapsing soundwaves or barcode-like strips, visually representingLZ77 compression and pop-music repetition.
    *   *Content:* Title, brief description of the Python project and song visualization.
    *   *Interactive:* Two glowing, pill-shaped buttons: one directing to the live site (`https://glglstats.geekip.dev`), and another featuring a minimalist play-icon linking to the PyData TLV YouTube presentation (`https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo`).
*   **Exhibit 2: Ahuzat Dibuk**
    *   *Visuals:* A crimson and orange heatmap-colored hologram. The background uses an animated CSS gradient mesh shifting through red, orange, and yellow to mimic a dynamic parking occupancy heatmap.
    *   *Content:* Title, description of the Python scraping and Tel-Aviv parking data.
    *   *Interactive:* A staggered list of glowing textual links to the media coverage (Channel 13, Mako) and the original Secret Tel-Aviv Facebook publication.
*   **Exhibit 3: 2D Part Orienting**
    *   *Visuals:* An electric blue, highly technical hologram. Inside the glass card, a geometric, neon polygon continuously rotates while being "pushed" into alignment by invisible glowing grid lines.
    *   *Content:* Title, explanation of the C++ open-source computational geometry push-plan algorithm.
    *   *Interactive:* A single, sharp, angular button linking to the CGL TAU project page (`https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/`).
*   **Exhibit 4: The Turing Jest**
    *   *Visuals:* A vibrant purple/magenta hologram. The visual motif includes two wireframe, digitized comedy masks that occasionally "glitch" to represent the battle between LLMs and humor.
    *   *Content:* Title, description of the LMSYS-like pun-explaining arena.
    *   *Interactive:* A prominent enter-arena button leading to `https://jest.geekip.dev`.
*   **Exhibit 5: Rhymes of Israel**
    *   *Visuals:* A golden-yellow hologram. The looping background visual represents a digital newspaper page dynamically folding itself into a graduation cap or high-school yearbook outline.
    *   *Content:* Title, description of the LLM-powered comedic news Chrome extension.
    *   *Interactive:* A button styled like a glowing Chrome logo linking to the extension store (`https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eainginjgdkpgolpjniijdihfbeeeklb`).
*   **Exhibit 6: A Meta Portfolio**
    *   *Visuals:* An iridescent, multi-colored hologram. To represent the "meta" nature of the site, the card should contain an infinite-mirror CSS effect (a glowing box within a box within a box, scaling infinitely inward).
    *   *Content:* Title, a cheeky description stating "You are currently inside this project."
    *   *Interactive:* A self-referential link pointing back to `https://geekip.dev`.

**The Exit Archway & Social Lounge (Section 7)**
As the user reaches the end of the scroll, the central path terminates at a massive, glowing archway. Floating in the center of this archway are three highly polished, 3D CSS spheres or rotating cubes representing the social links.
*   *Content:* Hovering over these geometric objects reveals the names and links: GitHub (`github.com/gevak`), LinkedIn (`linkedin.com/in/gevakip`), and Facebook (`facebook.com/geva.kipper`). 

**The Museum Plaque (Footer)**
Pinned below the social archway is a sleek, brass-textured or illuminated digital plaque. 
*   *Credit:* Engraved-style text reading: "Gallery architecture and conceptual design generated by AI."
*   *The Chronometer:* Below the credit, a digital stopwatch rendered in a glowing red, retro-futuristic LED font. Use JavaScript to calculate and actively display the running time (formatted as Hours:Minutes:Seconds) dynamically ticking upward, permanently counting the precise time elapsed since the baseline timestamp: `2026-03-01 01:46:22`.
