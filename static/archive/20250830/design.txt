**Overall Concept & Feel**

The website is a single-page, dark-themed, immersive terminal interface. The aesthetic is clean, minimalist, and cyberpunk-inspired, but with an elegant touch—think "neo-noir data terminal." The primary color palette is a deep charcoal/off-black background (`#1a1a1d`), with white and a vibrant electric cyan (`#61f2f5`) for text, highlights, and interactive elements. All text is rendered in a modern monospace font. The interaction is centered around a chatbot prompt, making the user an active investigator rather than a passive reader.

**Initial Page Load & Header**

Upon arrival, the screen is almost entirely black. A single, blinking cyan cursor `_` appears in the center of the viewport, next to a `>` prompt symbol. Above this prompt, text animates in as if being typed by the AI:

`[AI_PORTFOLIO_GEN_v4.2] ONLINE. DATA LOADED.`
`SUBJECT: Geva Kipper, Software Engineer @ Google, focusing on large-scale data processing infrastructure.`
`QUERY > _`

Directly beneath this interactive prompt, in a smaller, slightly dimmer white font, is the subtitle:
`// This site is procedurally regenerated by AI every 24 hours. Visuals and layout may vary.`

The user's first action is to type into the prompt. Typing "help" or "?" can reveal suggested commands like "show all projects", "tell me about his Python work", "what is The Turing Jest?", or "contact info".

**The Interaction & Content Reveal**

When the user enters a query (e.g., "show all projects") and hits Enter, the chatbot interface animates. The user's query locks in, and the AI's "response" types out beneath it. As the AI "describes" each project, the corresponding content box materializes on the page below the chat interface. The boxes don't just appear; they fade in with a subtle "glitch" effect and a soft cyan glow, arranging themselves in a dynamic, asymmetrical masonry grid that fills the screen space elegantly.

**Project & Content Box Design**

Each of the seven boxes is a semi-transparent dark grey card with a thin, 1px cyan border. On hover, the border’s glow intensifies slightly.

**Footer**

At the very bottom of the page, separated by a thin, glowing cyan line, is the footer. It is styled as system-level information in a smaller, dimmer white font.
