Design a single-page “product page for a human” that treats Geva Kipper as a software artifact with versions. The top of the page is a clean, centered hero on a slightly textured dark-to-light gradient (midnight blue → charcoal) with subtle “diff noise” speckles. Large title: **Geva Kipper**. Beneath it, one crisp sentence: **“Software Engineer at Google, building and improving large-scale systems.”** Directly under that, a smaller subtitle in a lighter weight: **“This portfolio is re-designed each day by AI, so it’s always a little different.”** The hero includes a prominent **Version selector** dropdown styled like a modern IDE control (rounded, frosted glass), labeled **“Select version (year)”** (e.g., 2018 → 2025). Next to it, a tiny inline “release note” pill that updates when the year changes: *“v2025 — current focus: LLM tooling + data/visualization projects”* (copy can be brief and adaptable).

The core concept: changing the version/year doesn’t navigate away; it “patches” the page. When a year is selected, the page animates like a git checkout: cards subtly shift position, accent colors change, and small inline “diff” highlights appear briefly (green underline for “added”, amber for “changed”) within section captions. Each project card has a small top-right badge that updates with the selected year (e.g., “Active”, “Prototype”, “Shipped”, “Revisited”), giving the feeling of growth over time without needing multiple pages. The background includes a faint vertical timeline ruler on the left edge that moves a glowing marker up/down with the selected year, reinforcing progression.

Layout: below the hero, use a **two-column responsive grid** (collapsing to one column on mobile). The sections are presented as **elegant cards** with a distinctive “versioned file” aesthetic: each card header looks like a tab in a code editor, with the project name as the filename and a tiny icon (Python/C++/Web/Extension). Cards are not flat rectangles; they have a subtle layered-paper effect, like stacked commits. Hovering a card reveals a “peek” state: the card slightly expands, and a short “commit message” line fades in (e.g., “feat: visualized repetition patterns in pop songs”). Each card contains: title, 1–2 sentence description, and clearly styled links (as rounded buttons) for site/video/articles. Keep typography modern: a clean sans (e.g., Inter-like) for body, and a slightly monospaced accent for versioning elements (dropdown label, badges, timestamps).

Sections (cards), in order, each with practical content and link placement:
1) **GlglStats.py** — Description: *Python project measuring repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression; visualizes repetition patterns in famous songs.* Links: primary button **“Visit site”** → https://glglstats.geekip.dev, secondary button **“Watch PyData TLV talk”** → https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo. Include a small inline “sparkline” style decoration implying repetition patterns (purely visual motif, not an actual chart requirement).
2) **AhuzatDibuk.scrape** — Description: *Python scraping + data visualization project collecting Tel-Aviv parking lot occupancy stats and generating resident-friendly heat maps.* Links: three compact buttons labeled **“13tv story”**, **“mako story”**, **“Facebook post”** with the provided URLs. Add a background heat-map-inspired gradient strip along the bottom edge of the card (subtle, tasteful).
3) **2D-Part-Orienting.cpp** — Description: *C++ implementation in an open-source computational geometry library: efficient algorithm constructing a push plan to orient a polygon.* Link button **“More info & code”** → https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/. Add a thin line-art polygon motif in the header, like a blueprint.
4) **TheTuringJest.web** — Description: *An arena (LMSYS-like) where LLMs compete at making and explaining puns; users rate the answers.* Link button **“Enter the arena”** → https://jest.geekip.dev. Add a small playful touch: a minimal “speech bubble vs speech bubble” icon, still within an elegant style.
5) **RhymesOfIsrael.extension** — Description: *Chrome extension using an LLM to rewrite Israeli news headlines into comedic rhymes in the style of a highschool yearbook.* Link button **“Install from Chrome Web Store”** → https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eainginjgdkpgolpjniijdihfbeeeklb. Use a subtle newspaper headline motif in the background, very low contrast.
6) **geekip.dev (meta)** — Description: *A portfolio website project about… portfolio websites. Designed as a living artifact that evolves daily.* Link button **“Self reference”** → https://geekip.dev. This card should visually “glitch” the least: instead, it should look like a clean README, making it feel self-aware and stable.
7) **Links (socials)** — A final card styled like a “remote origins” panel: three large, clean icon+text rows (no clutter), each as a single click target: **github.com/gevak**, **linkedin.com/in/gevakip**, **facebook.com/geva.kipper**. On hover, each row shows a tiny tooltip-like label (e.g., “origin: github”) consistent with the version-control theme.

At the bottom, include a slim footer bar that looks like a terminal status line. Left side: **“Designed by AI (ChatGPT)”** as a credit line, with a small “model stamp” feel (monospace, subtle border). Right side: a live **stopwatch** labeled **“Uptime since 2025-12-30 01:10:51”** showing **HH:MM:SS** and updating every second. The footer stays visible when nearing the bottom (or gently fades in when scrolling down), reinforcing the “running system” metaphor. The overall feel should be elegant and minimal, but with distinctive version-control micro-interactions—small, tasteful “diff” hints and tab-like headers—so the theme reads instantly as “growth by year” without becoming gimmicky.
