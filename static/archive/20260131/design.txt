**Visual Concept: The "Living Code" IDE**

**Overall Aesthetic & Typography**
The site mimics a futuristic, high-fidelity Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with a "Glassmorphism" twist. The background is a deep, matte obsidian (`#1a1b26`), providing a high-contrast canvas for neon syntax highlighting colors (cyan, magenta, lime green, and soft yellow). The font is a premium monospaced typeface like *JetBrains Mono* or *Fira Code* with ligatures enabled. The design should feel mathematically precise, using subtle grid lines in the background that fade in and out like a breathing pulse.

**The Initial State: The Seed Line**
Upon loading, the entire browser window is empty except for a single, vertically and horizontally centered line of code in large, elegant text. It reads:
`const developer = new GevaKipper({ currentRole: "Google" });`

To the right of this line is a blinking cursor. Just below it, in a muted gray comment style, sits the subtitle:
`// v.2024.1: This interface is re-dreamed daily by an AI. Design creates itself.`

**The Interaction ( The Expansion)**
When the user hovers over the code line, the surrounding curly braces glow. On click, the line does not simply disappear; it splits. The `const developer` portion moves to the top left (becoming the logo), and the `;` moves to the bottom right. The screen undergoes a smooth "code folding" expansion animation. It looks as if the user has clicked a "plus" sign on a collapsed code block, expanding lines 1 through 100 in split-second fluidity. This expansion reveals the core grid of the 6 project boxes nestled inside the original function logic.

**The Grid: The "Main Function" Body**
The center of the screen is now a 2x3 grid. Each box interprets a project not as a standard card, but as a syntax-highlighted code block that "compiles" into visual content upon interaction.

*   **Default State:** Each box looks like a JSON object or a Python dictionary defining the project (e.g., `Project: "GlglStats"`, `Language: "Python"`). The borders are thin, glowing slightly in different syntax colors.
*   **Hover State:** When a user hovers over a block, the code "compiles." The text fades back, and the background of the card transforms into the relevant visual media (videos play, heatmaps glow).

**Detailed Section Breakdown:**

1.  **GlglStats:**
    *   *Visual:* A Python dictionary structure.
    *   *Hover Effect:* The background turns into a dynamic audio-visualizer (bars moving to music) representing the LZ77 compression and pop-chart patterns. The YouTube video of the PyData presentation plays automatically on hover in a muted overlay.
    *   *Action:* Clicking opens the `glglstats` URL.

2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk:**
    *   *Visual:* A dataset structure layout.
    *   *Hover Effect:* A stylized map of Tel-Aviv fades in, overlayed with a shifting red-to-green heatmap representing parking occupancy.
    *   *Action:* Contains three distinct "import" links styled as code buttons: "Import News_13", "Import Mako", and "Import Facebook_Source".

3.  **2D Part Orienting:**
    *   *Visual:* C++ syntax pointers.
    *   *Hover Effect:* An SVG animation of a polygon being pushed against a wall and rotating until it aligns perfectly, looping infinitely.
    *   *Action:* Links to the CGL project page.

4.  **The Turing Jest:**
    *   *Visual:* Looks like a chat log array.
    *   *Hover Effect:* A split-screen chat interface appears where two robot icons are firing puns at each other, with a score counter ticking up rapidly.
    *   *Action:* Links to the Jest arena.

5.  **Rhymes of Israel:**
    *   *Visual:* A browser extension manifest file.
    *   *Hover Effect:* A snippet of a serious Hebrew news headline glitches and rewrites itself into a whimsical rhyme in a handwritten font style.
    *   *Action:* A large "Install" button styled like a Chrome Web Store badge.

6.  **Meta-Portfolio (Self Reference):**
    *   *Visual:* A recursive function definition: `function renderPortfolio() { return renderPortfolio(); }`.
    *   *Hover Effect:* The card shows a live, miniature iframe of the current website (Droste effect), creating an infinite tunnel of the site inside itself.
    *   *Action:* Reloads the page (or links to geekip.dev as requested).

**The Bottom Section: Imports & Console**
Beneath the grid, floating near the bottom, is the "Imports" section. These are not icons, but standard code import include statements:
*   `import { Profile } from "linkedin/gevakip"`
*   `import { Repos } from "github/gevak"`
*   `import { Social } from "facebook/geva.kipper"`
Each string is a clickable link.

**The Footer: The Terminal Output**
Fixed to the absolute bottom of the viewport is a dark "Terminal" or "Console Log" bar.
*   **Left side:** `> Created by AI Model [Generic_ID]. Rendering complete.`
*   **Right side:** A minimalist digital stopwatch. It calculates the time delta from the future date *2026-01-31 01:21:17*. Since the date is in the future, the counter should show a negative "T-Minus" countdown (e.g., `T-Minus: 12,400h 30m 12s`) or simply the raw elapsed time difference, styled in bright red to indicate a temporal anomaly.
