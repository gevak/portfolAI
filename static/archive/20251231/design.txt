Single-page layout styled like a premium bug tracker (“IssueBoard”) with an elegant, slightly playful “resolved ticket” aesthetic. The page background is a soft off-white with faint gridlines and occasional “watermark” UI elements (ghosted status pills, labels, and subtle ticket numbers) to create depth without clutter. Typography: a modern sans (Inter/SF-style) for UI labels and body text, paired with a monospace (JetBrains Mono-style) for IDs, timestamps, and code-like snippets. The color palette is mostly neutral (charcoal, slate, warm gray) with one accent color that rotates daily (used for highlights, borders, and status icons), reinforcing the “AI redesigns daily” concept.

At the very top: a fixed, slim “tracker header bar” containing the site title on the left (“IssueBoard”), a search field mock (“Search issues…”) in the center (purely aesthetic), and a right-side cluster of tiny UI chips: “Assignee: Geva Kipper”, “Milestone: Portfolio”, and a green “All checks passed” indicator. Beneath it, a hero section that looks like the top of a ticket page: large name “Geva Kipper” with a single-sentence current-work line directly below: “Software Engineer at Google, currently building and improving large-scale systems and developer-facing tooling.” Under that, a subtitle styled as an info banner (light blue background, rounded corners, small “spark” icon): “This portfolio is re-designed each day by AI—an ever-changing interface with the same resolved outcomes.” To the right of the hero, a small “Daily Build” card showing: “Theme seed: YYYY-MM-DD”, “Layout variant: A/B/C”, and “Accent: <color name>” (pure UI flavor).

The main content is a vertical list of “Resolved Issues” cards, each presented like a closed ticket with consistent structure: a left gutter with an icon and status (a green check in a circle and the label “Resolved”), a bold issue title line with an issue number (e.g., “#0123”), and a compact metadata row beneath (tags like language, domain, year/era, and a playful “Severity” label like “Severity: Delightful”). Each card expands on hover (or subtle “open” affordance) with a slightly raised elevation and a thin accent border. Inside each card, content is arranged in two columns on desktop (single column on mobile): left column is the “Description” written like a bug resolution summary; right column is “Artifacts” with link buttons, previews, or embedded media. Use small UI elements: pill tags, tiny timestamps, and a “Resolution” block that reads like a commit message.

1) **Resolved Issue: “GlglStats”**  
Title line: “#0001 GlglStats — Measure repetition in Israeli pop via LZ77” with tags: `Python`, `Compression`, `DataViz`, `Music`. Description reads like: “Root cause: catchy choruses. Fix: quantify repetitiveness using LZ77 compression signals; visualize repetition patterns across iconic tracks.” Artifacts panel includes two prominent buttons: “Open site” linking to `https://glglstats.geekip.dev` and “Watch PyData TLV talk” linking to `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo`. Include a small embedded video thumbnail-style preview (YouTube card look) and a miniature chart preview (stylized waveform/heat strip) as a decorative image placeholder area (no code, just specify the visual).

2) **Resolved Issue: “Ahuzat Dibuk”**  
Title line: “#0002 Ahuzat Dibuk — Tel-Aviv parking occupancy heat-maps” with tags: `Python`, `Scraping`, `Heatmaps`, `CivicData`. Description framed like an incident response: “Symptom: residents circle endlessly. Resolution: scrape lot occupancy, aggregate stats, publish heat-maps for practical decision-making.” Artifacts panel presents three link rows styled like “Related incidents / press”:  
- `https://13tv.co.il/item/news/domestic/internal/parking-902956407/`  
- `https://www.mako.co.il/nexter-news/Article-ae43964b891bf71027.htm`  
- “Original post” linking to `https://www.facebook.com/groups/secrettelaviv/posts/10159636301195943/`  
Add a small “Map preview” block (a tasteful, blurred heatmap thumbnail) with a caption-like label: “Heat-map snapshot (example).”

3) **Resolved Issue: “2D Part Orienting”**  
Title line: “#0003 2D Part Orienting — Efficient push-plan for polygon orientation (C++)” with tags: `C++`, `ComputationalGeometry`, `OpenSource`, `Algorithms`. Description reads like a library patch note: “Implemented an efficient algorithm to construct a push plan to orient a given polygon, integrated into an open-source computational geometry library.” Artifacts panel contains a primary “Docs & code” button linking to `https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/`, plus a small schematic-style thumbnail (clean line art of a polygon and arrows) to reinforce the geometry feel.

4) **Resolved Issue: “The Turing Jest”**  
Title line: “#0004 The Turing Jest — LLM arena for puns + explanations” with tags: `LLMs`, `Arena`, `UX`, `Humor`. Description presented like a product ticket: “Built an LMSYS-like arena where models compete at making and explaining puns; users rate responses to surface genuinely clever wordplay.” Artifacts include a strong CTA button “Enter arena” linking to `https://jest.geekip.dev`. The card can feature a “recent match” mini-widget style (static design element): two side-by-side speech bubbles labeled “Model A” vs “Model B”, with a tiny “User rating” bar beneath—purely visual for personality.

5) **Resolved Issue: “Rhymes of Israel”**  
Title line: “#0005 Rhymes of Israel — News headlines rewritten into yearbook-style rhymes” with tags: `ChromeExtension`, `LLM`, `NLP`, `Satire`. Description: “Transforms Israeli news headlines into comedic rhymes in the style of a highschool yearbook—because the internet needed one more reason to smile.” Artifacts panel includes a “Install from Chrome Web Store” button linking to `https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eainginjgdkpgolpjniijdihfbeeeklb`, plus a faux preview area that resembles a browser extension popup (rounded rectangle, headline line, rhymed result line).

6) **Resolved Issue: “Portfolio Website (Meta)”**  
Title line: “#0006 Portfolio — Bug tracker aesthetic, AI daily redesign” with tags: `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `DesignSystem`. Description reads like the ticket that created itself: “Resolved by shipping a single-page issue board where every project is a closed case; redesigned daily by AI but grounded in the same artifacts.” Artifacts panel includes a “Self reference” button linking to `https://geekip.dev`. Add a whimsical “Automation” sub-block with checklist items (visual only): “Lint: passed”, “Build: green”, “Deploy: complete”, “Theme mutation: scheduled daily.”

7) **Resolved Issue: “Contact & Links”**  
Final card looks like a “User / Org” panel rather than a project ticket, but still marked Resolved. Title: “#0007 Social links — find the maintainer” with tags: `GitHub`, `LinkedIn`, `Facebook`. Inside: three large, clean link rows with corresponding minimalist icons and the exact URLs:  
- `github.com/gevak`  
- `linkedin.com/in/gevakip`  
- `facebook.com/geva.kipper`  
Include a small “PGP-notice-like” monospace line underneath for flair (not actual keys): “Preferred channel: GitHub issues / LinkedIn.”

Throughout the page, add micro-interactions in the design spec: hover shows a subtle “open ticket” chevron; clicking a card could visually “expand” like an issue detail view (accordion behavior) with a smooth transition; anchors and buttons have crisp focus states. Between cards, place thin dividers that resemble timeline separators with tiny timestamps (decorative) like “Resolved at: <date>” using the daily seed for consistency. On mobile, the left status gutter collapses into a top row with the status pill.

Footer spans full width like a tracker footer bar. Left side: a credit line in small UI text: “Generated by ChatGPT (OpenAI) — AI design synthesis.” Right side: a “Stopwatch since” module in monospace with a tiny clock icon and label: “Uptime since 2025-12-31 01:12:25” followed by a live-running timer formatted `HH:MM:SS` (hours can exceed 24). The stopwatch block should look like a compact system widget (dark-on-light, subtle border, rounded corners) and remain visible even when the user reaches the bottom, creating a satisfying “system status” finish.
