**Visual Theme & Atmosphere**

The overall aesthetic should be a high-fidelity **"Classified Digital Dossier"** blending the urgency of a *Mission: Impossible* briefing with the glitchy, generative chaos of an AI system. The background is a deep, textured charcoal (hex #0f0f0f) with a subtle, animated noise grain overlay to mimic film stock or an unstable video feed. The primary accent colors are "Terminal Green" and "Alert Red."

Typography should be strictly monospaced (e.g., 'Courier Prime' or 'Fira Code') to resemble a raw data dump or a typewriter, while headers use a bold, stencil-style military font. The entire page feels "volatile"—interactive elements should flicker slightly on hover, and the borders of the site should have a slow, burning particle effect, reinforcing the "self-destruct" theme.

**Header: The Mission Briefing**

The top of the page features a bold, red-stamped banner reading **"EYES ONLY / RECRUITER CLEARANCE VERIFIED."**

*   **Profile Section:** Geva Kipper’s name appears in large, typing-effect text that looks like it is being decrypted in real-time (random characters resolving into the final letters).
*   **Current Status:** Directly below the name, the sentence regarding his work at Google appears as a "Mission Status" line item, highlighted in a semi-transparent green box.
*   **The AI Subtitle:** The subtitle ("This website is re-designed each day by AI...") should look like a system warning or a terminal log entry. It should be styled with a subtle "glitch" animation, implying the AI is actively rewriting the DOM structure as the user watches.

**The Grid: The Evidence Locker**

The main content area is a bento-box style CSS grid. However, instead of standard cards, each box is designed to look like a **"File"** or **"Evidence Asset"** inside a dossier. The container borders are thin technical lines with corner brackets.

**Box 1: GlglStats (The Repetitiveness Analyzer)**
*   **Visual:** The background of this card features a faint, animating audio waveform visualization.
*   **Content:** The title is styled as a technical schematic. The video link should not be a plain text link but a button styled as a "Play Surveillance Footage" toggle.
*   **Interaction:** Hovering over this box causes the compression algorithm data to scroll rapidly in the background matrix-style.

**Box 2: Ahuzat Dibuk (Parking Forensics)**
*   **Visual:** This box utilizes a localized heatmap visual as a background, with areas glowing red and orange.
*   **Content:** The link links to news stories and the Facebook post should be styled as "Intercepted Communications" or "Public Record Leaks," using icon-based buttons (a newspaper icon and a social graph icon).

**Box 3: 2D Part Orienting (Geometry & Algorithms)**
*   **Visual:** A minimalist wireframe polygon rotates slowly in the center of the card.
*   **Content:** The description acts as a caption for this geometric anomaly. The link to the code looks like a "Download Blueprint" command.

**Box 4: The Turing Jest (LLM Arena)**
*   **Visual:** Split the background into two contrasting distinct colors (blue vs. red) representing the competiting LLMs.
*   **Content:** The text is contained within chat bubbles reminiscent of a messaging app. The link to the site is a button labeled "Enter The Arena."

**Box 5: Rhymes of Israel (The Comedic Extension)**
*   **Visual:** A torn-paper aesthetic. The background looks like a newsprint texture, but the text overlay uses a playful, slightly comic-book font for the headlines to contrast the seriousness of the underlying news.
*   **Content:** The Chrome Store link is styled as a "Install Patch" button.

**Box 6: The Meta-Portfolio (Self-Reference)**
*   **Visual:** An "Infinity Mirror" effect. The background is a screenshot of the website itself, which contains a screenshot of the website, recursively.
*   **Content:** A "You Are Here" GPS marker pulse overlays the center. The link text reads "Recursion Entry Point."

**Box 7: Contact Links (The Extraction Points)**
*   **Visual:** Designed to look like an ID card or a passport page.
*   **Content:**
    *   **GitHub:** Represented by a "Source Code Clearance" barcode.
    *   **LinkedIn:** Represented by a "Professional Dossier" stamp.
    *   **Facebook:** Represented by a "Civilian Identity" photo placeholder.

**Footer: System Diagnostics**

The bottom of the page acts as the system status bar.

*   **AI Credit:** A small, monospaced line aligned to the left: *“Architected by AI Model [Version Redacted]. Iteration #842.”*
*   **The Stopwatch:** Aligned to the right, a prominent digital timer counts *up* (ticking upwards). It is labeled **"TIME ELAPSED SINCE INCIDENT 2025-11-19."** The numbers are bright red LED style. This adds a mysterious narrative element—implying the website is a response to a specific event in the future, effectively turning the portfolio into a time-capsule artifact from a future timeline.

**Interaction & UX**

To finalize the "Self-Destructing" feel for the hiring manager: Upon clicking any external link (to view a project), the screen momentarily flashes white and fades to a "Signal Lost" static screen for 0.5 seconds before correctly redirecting the user, leaving the impression that the dossier has been sealed behind them.
