### Website Design: Geva Kipper's Retro-Emulated Portfolio

**Overall Concept:** The website is a full-screen, single-page application that emulates a retro console's operating system. The user experience is designed to feel like navigating a vintage gaming menu. The aesthetic is a modern take on 8-bit/16-bit interfaces, combining pixel art with smooth animations, dark themes, and glowing neon accents. The color palette is predominantly dark charcoal and deep navy, with highlighted text and interactive elements in cyan, magenta, and amber. The entire interface is contained within a soft, virtual CRT screen effect, with subtle scan lines and a very slight curvature at the edges.

**The Boot Sequence (Initial Page Load):**
Upon visiting the site, the screen is black. A single, blinking underscore cursor appears in the top-left corner. A boot-up sequence is typed out character-by-character with accompanying key-press sound effects:

`GEEKIP.DEV BIOS v2.7…`
`Initializing Memory… OK`
`Loading Geva Kipper OS…`
`Detecting Projects… 6 Found`

A pixelated logo of a brain combined with a joystick briefly flashes on screen with a classic 8-bit chime. The screen then glitches for a moment before resolving into the main interface. This entire animation is quick (3-4 seconds) and skippable with a click or keypress.

**Main Interface Layout:**

The screen is divided into three primary sections.

1.  **Header Info:** At the top of the screen, the developer's name and details are displayed in a clean, readable pixel font.
    -   **Title:** `GEVA KIPPER` in large, glowing cyan letters.
    -   **Bio:** Directly below, in a smaller, white pixel font: `Currently building the future of conversational AI at Google.`
    -   **Subtitle:** Underneath the bio, in a flickering amber font: `// This site's design is regenerated daily by AI; content and layout may vary.`

2.  **Project Selector (The "Cartridge Grid"):**
    The main content area consists of a 3x2 grid of "game cartridges". Each cartridge represents a project. They are not simple boxes, but styled to look like classic game cartridges with a distinct pixel-art label icon. On hover, the selected cartridge levitates slightly, emits a soft neon glow, and its title appears below it. A subtle, low-fi *blip* sound plays.

3.  **Display Screen (The "CRT Output"):**
    Below the cartridge grid is a large, rectangular area that serves as the "display" for the selected project. Initially, this area is idle, showing a slow-drifting, pixelated screensaver (e.g., a bouncing logo). When a project cartridge is clicked, a short "loading" animation plays—the cartridge icon appears to slot into a virtual console—and this display area instantly populates with the project's details.

**Project & Content Sections (As displayed on the CRT Output):**

When a cartridge is clicked, the display screen populates with the following, all styled within the retro theme. Links are styled as glowing, selectable menu items, like `[> LAUNCH SITE]`.

1.  **Cartridge "GlglStats":**
    -   **Icon:** A pixelated musical eighth note and a bar graph.
    -   **Display:** A description of the Python project analyzing song repetitiveness using LZ77. A small, animated pixel-art visualization shows a sine wave pattern morphing.
    -   **Links:** `[> ANALYZE THE CHARTS]`, `[> WATCH PYDATA TALK]`

2.  **Cartridge "Ahuzat Dibuk":**
    -   **Icon:** A pixel-art top-down view of a red car in a parking spot.
    -   **Display:** A description of the parking occupancy data project. A looping pixel animation shows a tiny heat-map of Tel-Aviv glowing from green to red.
    -   **Links:** `[> READ CHANNEL 13 NEWS]`, `[> READ MAKO STORY]`, `[> VIEW ORIGINAL POST]`

3.  **Cartridge "2D Part Orienting":**
    -   **Icon:** A simple, solid-color polygon rotating.
    -   **Display:** A description of the C++ computational geometry algorithm. A schematic animation shows a series of arrows "pushing" a polygon into a target orientation.
    -   **Link:** `[> VIEW ALGORITHM & CODE]`

4.  **Cartridge "The Turing Jest":**
    -   **Icon:** A pixelated joker's hat with a question mark on it.
    -   **Display:** An explanation of the LLM-powered pun arena. An animation shows two pixelated robot heads with speech bubbles appearing above them.
    -   **Link:** `[> ENTER THE ARENA]`

5.  **Cartridge "Rhymes of Israel":**
    -   **Icon:** A pixel-art newspaper with a rhyming couplet appearing on it.
    -   **Display:** A description of the Chrome extension that rewrites headlines. A simple animation shows a news headline text being replaced, letter by letter, with a new, rhyming one.
    -   **Link:** `[> INSTALL FROM CHROME STORE]`

6.  **Cartridge "geekip.dev":**
    -   **Icon:** A pixelated retro handheld console (like a Game Boy).
    -   **Display:** The meta-project description: "A retro game console emulator that boots my projects. You're looking at it."
    -   **Link:** `[> REBOOT_SYSTEM( )]` (links to itself, reloading the page with the boot sequence).

**Footer Section:**

At the very bottom of the page, below the main interface, is a static footer area.

-   **Social Links:** This section is titled `>_CONNECT`. Below it are three icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook, rendered as glowing, 32x32 pixel sprites. On hover, the icon's color brightens.

-   **AI & Timer:** Centered at the very bottom of the page, in a small, slightly dimmed pixel font:
    `Designed by a generative AI model.`
    `System Uptime: [A real-time stopwatch counting up from 2025-07-20 01:19:09 in HH:MM:SS format]`
