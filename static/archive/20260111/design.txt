**Visual Style & Atmosphere**
The website should adopt a “Pixel-Art Dungeon Crawler” aesthetic reminiscent of high-fantasy 16-bit era RPGs (like *Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past* or *Final Fantasy VI*). The color palette should be dominated by deep indigos, charcoal greys for stone walls, and warm torchlight oranges for highlights. Overlay a subtle CRT scanline effect and a slow vignette breathing animation to make the screen feel like an arcade monitor. The typography must use a crisp, monospaced 8-bit font (e.g., "Press Start 2P") for headers and a legible pixel-serif font for body text.

**The Hero (Header & HUD)**
The top of the screen functions as a static Heads-Up Display (HUD). On the left, a pixelated avatar of Geva serves as the health portrait. Next to it, the text reads: **"Player: Geva Kipper"** followed by **"Class: Software Engineer @ Google"**. Below this, a sub-stat bar flickers slightly with a glitch effect, displaying the text: *"Reality construct #842. This dungeon is re-designed daily by AI."*

**Navigation Mechanics: Scroll-to-Walk**
Instead of using keyboard arrows, the site utilizes a "Scroll-to-Walk" mechanic. As the user touches their screen or uses the mouse wheel to scroll down, the 8-bit character (Geva) physically walks down a winding dungeon path in the center of the screen. The faster the user scrolls, the faster the character sprints. If the user stops, the character plays an "idle" animation (checking a phone or tapping a foot). The background moves partially via parallax to create depth.

**The Dungeon Rooms (Project Boxes)**
The single page is divided into "Rooms." As the character enters a room, they encounter an interactive object representing a project. When the object enters the viewport, a retro RPG dialog box (bordered in gold pixels) expands from the object to present the content.

*   **Room 1: The Bard’s Corner (GlglStats)**
    *   **Visual:** The room is decorated with pixelated musical notes floating in the air. In the center sits a large, animated gramophone.
    *   **The Box:** The dialog box displays the "GlglStats" title. It features a mini-visualizer graphic of compression bars. It includes the description of the reptitiveness algorithm and two distinct geometric buttons: "Play Demo" (Video Link) and "Enter Source" (Website Link).

*   **Room 2: The Grid of Streets (Ahuzat Dibuk)**
    *   **Visual:** The dungeon floor turns into asphalt with parking markings. A pixelated car is parked in the center.
    *   **The Box:** A "Data Scroll" pops up showing a heatmap grid of Tel-Aviv. The text explains the scraping project. Three button-links resemble newspaper icons and a Facebook "Like" thumb, leading to the news stories and the original post.

*   **Room 3: The Geometry Chamber (2D Part Orienting)**
    *   **Visual:** The walls are lined with mathematical symbols. In the center, a floating polygon rotates slowly.
    *   **The Box:** The text explains the C++ implementation and "Push strategies." The link to the project is styled as a "Blueprint" icon.

*   **Room 4: The Arena of Wits (The Turing Jest)**
    *   **Visual:** A gladiatorial arena style with two pixelated robots facing each other (representing LLMs).
    *   **The Box:** The text describes the puns competition. A prominent "Fight!" button serves as the link to the site.

*   **Room 5: The Yearbook Library (Rhymes of Israel)**
    *   **Visual:** Large bookshelves line the walls. A giant, open book sits on a pedestal.
    *   **The Box:** Specifically styled like a high school yearbook page. The text describes the comedic headline re-writer. The link is a "Chrome Extension" puzzle-piece icon labeled "Equip Spell".

*   **Room 6: The Hall of Mirrors (Portfolio)**
    *   **Visual:** The room is empty except for a large, reflective mirror in the center. When the character walks past it, the reflection shows the layout of the website itself.
    *   **The Box:** Text reads: "A recursion loop detected." It links recursively to `geekip.dev`.

**The Treasure Room (Contact)**
At the end of the dungeon is a room filled with gold piles. Three large treasure chests sit side-by-side. When the character reaches them, they pop open to reveal floating icons:
1.  **GitHub Logo** (Pixelated Octocat)
2.  **LinkedIn Logo**
3.  **Facebook Logo**

**The Footer: System Diagnostics**
Beneath the dungeon floor, visually separated as a "System Terminal" black bar:
*   **Left Side:** "Architect: Construct created by [AI Model Name]."
*   **Right Side:** A stark, red digital stopwatch. It calculates the time delta from the future date **2026-01-11 01:20:09**. If the date is in the future relative to the viewer, the timer counts down with a "T-Minus to Singularity" label. If the date is in the past, it counts up with a "Time Since Epoch" label. (Given the prompt implies a "passed since" logic, the timer should format as: `HH:MM:SS since Reset`).
