### **Overall Concept & User Experience**

The website is a single-page, vertical-scrolling 2D platformer. The background is a dark, charcoal-gray canvas. The player character is a small, glowing cyan cube. As the user scrolls down, the cube automatically runs and jumps along a path of thin, glowing cyan platforms suspended in the dark space. Each major platform the character lands on represents a project, triggering the appearance of its corresponding info box. The entire experience is fluid and animated, with a minimalist, "tron-like" aesthetic. The primary font is a clean, modern sans-serif (e.g., Inter), with a monospaced font for the final stopwatch.

### **Initial View (The "Start Screen")**

Upon loading, the screen is dark. The name **Geva Kipper** fades in, large and centered. Below it, in a smaller font, appears the sentence: "A software engineer at Google, focusing on large-scale data infrastructure."

Underneath this, a slightly smaller, shimmering subtitle fades in: "This site is re-designed each day by AI and is thus ever-changing."

The glowing cyan player cube is visible at the bottom of the screen, standing on the first small platform. A softly pulsing down-arrow icon appears next to it, inviting the user to scroll. The character has a subtle idle animation, gently bobbing up and down.

### **The Game World & Project Levels**

As the user scrolls, the view pans down, and the character begins to move. It runs along simple line-platforms and performs small, pre-animated jumps to reach the five main "project islands." Each project island is a larger, uniquely shaped platform that hints at the project's theme. When the character lands on an island, its corresponding content box elegantly fades into view nearby.

**1. Project Island: GlglStats**
*   **Platform Shape:** A glowing, stylized soundwave.
*   **Content Box:** A semi-transparent, dark rectangle with a soft glow effect (glassmorphism).
    *   **Title:** GlglStats
    *   **Description:** A Python project measuring the repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression, featuring visualizations of repetition patterns.
    *   **Links:** Two glowing cyan buttons with icons.

**2. Project Island: Ahuzat Dibuk**
*   **Platform Shape:** A glowing grid pattern that resembles a city map or a parking lot layout.
*   **Content Box:**
    *   **Title:** Ahuzat Dibuk
    *   **Description:** A Python scraping and data visualization project that collects statistics on Tel-Aviv parking lot occupancy, generating heat-maps for residents.
    *   **Links:** Three smaller, icon-based links arranged horizontally.

        *   `[Facebook Icon]` -> Original Facebook Post

**3. Project Island: 2D Part Orienting**
*   **Platform Shape:** A glowing, non-convex polygon.
*   **Content Box:**
    *   **Title:** 2D Part Orienting
    *   **Description:** A C++ implementation of an efficient algorithm for constructing a 'push plan' to orient a given polygon, contributed to an open-source computational geometry library.
    *   **Link:** One button.

**4. Project Island: This Portfolio**
*   **Platform Shape:** A glowing spiral, representing recursion or a self-reference.
*   **Content Box:**
    *   **Title:** The Ever-Changing Portfolio
    *   **Description:** This meta-project is the very site you are playing throughâ€”a portfolio designed as a single-page game.
    *   **Link:** One button.

**5. Final Island: The Contact Hub**
*   **Platform Shape:** A large, solid, circular "home base" platform.
*   **Interaction:** No content box appears. Instead, three large, glowing icons are embedded directly onto the platform's surface: one for GitHub, one for LinkedIn, and one for Facebook. As the player character "walks" over each icon, it brightens intensely, and clicking it opens the corresponding link in a new tab.

### **Footer Section**

After scrolling past the final contact island, the game elements and platforms fade away completely, leaving a clean, dark background. The following text fades in at the very bottom of the page, centered and in a simple, elegant font.

Below this text, a live stopwatch is displayed in a prominent monospaced font, actively counting up in hours, minutes, and seconds from the specified date and time.
