### Geva Kipper's Portfolio: The "GeekIP Subway"

**Overall Vibe:** The website is a single-page, dark-themed, interactive application. The background is a very dark charcoal gray (#181818) with a subtle, static-like grain texture, giving it a sophisticated and digital feel. The primary font for headings is a clean, modern sans-serif like 'Inter', while descriptions and body text use a highly readable sans-serif like 'Roboto'. The entire experience is smooth, with fluid animations.

**Header Section:**
At the top of the page, centered, is the main title.
The name, **Geva Kipper**, is displayed in large, crisp white letters. Below it, in a slightly smaller, muted gray font, is the single sentence: "Developing innovative search and discovery features at Google."

Beneath this, a thin, glowing, electric-blue horizontal line separates the header from the main content. Just below this line, in a smaller, monospace font that subtly flickers as if being typed and re-typed by a terminal, is the subtitle: `"This site's design is regenerated daily by an AI. All content is subject to change without notice."`

**The Interactive Subway Map:**
The main body of the page is dominated by a stylized, abstract subway map. The map doesn't represent a real city but is a logical network of lines and stations. The lines are not straight but have gentle, 45- and 90-degree bends, typical of transit maps.

*   **Lines as Tech Stacks:** There are four main "lines," each with a distinct, vibrant color that glows softly against the dark background.
    *   **Python Line (Yellow):** A bright, warm yellow.
    *   **C++ Line (Blue):** A sharp, electric blue.
    *   **AI/LLM Line (Magenta):** A futuristic, glowing magenta.
    *   **Web/JS Line (Green):** A vivid, tech-green.

*   **Stations as Projects:** Each of the six main projects is a "station" on the map.
    *   **Standard Station:** A simple, solid white circle with a colored ring around it, matching the line it's on.
    *   **Interchange Station:** A station that sits on two or more lines (e.g., a project using Python and AI) is represented by a thicker white circle with multiple concentric colored rings, one for each line it connects.
    *   **Station Labels:** The name of the project is written next to its station marker in a small, clean, white font.

    On page load, the lines animate, drawing themselves onto the screen from a central point, followed by the stations pulsing into view one by one.

**Interaction and Content Display:**
The map is the primary navigation. Hovering over a station causes its marker and name to brighten and its corresponding line(s) to pulse with light.

Clicking on a station does not navigate away. Instead, a sleek, semi-transparent dark gray panel slides in from the right side of the screen, covering about one-third of the viewport. The subway map remains visible but is dimmed to bring focus to the panel. The panel has a thin, glowing border matching the color of the primary line for that station.
