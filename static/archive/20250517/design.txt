# Tetris Portfolio: Playable Blocks Revealing Projects

## Core Design Concept
A playable Tetris game where completed lines don't disappear but instead reveal project information. The falling Tetris pieces initially obscure the portfolio content, and as the user plays and completes lines, project details are gradually unveiled.

## Header
- "Geva Kipper" in large, pixelated retro gaming font
- Subtitle: "Senior Software Engineer at Google, specializing in distributed systems and algorithms"
- Dynamic subheader in smaller text: "This portfolio is redesigned daily by AI and never looks the same twice"
- Tetris score counter in the top right corner

## Game Interface
- The main portion of the screen is a classic Tetris grid
- Initially, the grid is partially filled with static blocks in various colors
- Hidden behind these blocks are the five project sections
- Standard Tetris controls (arrow keys, spacebar) with visual control guide
- Mobile version uses touch controls with visible buttons

## Project Revelation Mechanism
- When a line is completed, instead of disappearing, it transforms into a transparent layer revealing part of a project section
- Each project section is hidden behind differently colored blocks
- As more lines are completed in a section, more project details are revealed
- Each section has an "unlock fully" button if users prefer to skip the game

## Project Sections Design
1. **GlglStats**: Visualized as music bars with animated waves; includes embedded YouTube video thumbnail and link to the site
2. **Ahuzat Dibuk**: Heat-map styled background with parking lot illustrations; news links appear as newspaper clippings
3. **2D Part Orienting**: Geometric polygon animations that rotate and orient themselves; code snippets visible in the background
4. **Portfolio Website**: Self-referential design with nested Tetris boards that zoom in infinitely (Droste effect)
5. **Social Links**: Each platform represented by a Tetris piece shape with the corresponding icon

## Additional Elements
- Background music toggles between Tetris theme and ambient coding sounds
- Easter egg: Konami code reveals a full CV/resume overlay
- "Skip Game" button for visitors who want immediate access to all content
- Responsive design that adjusts Tetris board size based on screen dimensions

## Footer
- Credit line: "Design conceptualized by Claude AI on [current date]"
- Stopwatch in pixelated font counting time since 2025-05-17 01:06:01
- Theme toggle between "Classic Tetris" and "Modern Minimal" modes

## Color Scheme
- Base dark theme with high-contrast neon Tetris pieces
- Each project section has its own color identity
- Color-blind friendly mode available via settings icon

## Loading Experience
- Site initially loads as a Tetris "Level 1" screen
- Brief animation of Tetris pieces falling to form Geva's initials before game begins
