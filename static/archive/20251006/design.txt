# Arcade Cabinet Portfolio Design

The entire webpage is styled as a vintage arcade cabinet viewed from a slight isometric angle, with a rich purple-to-blue gradient background suggesting a dark arcade hall with ambient neon lighting effects pulsing subtly in the background.

At the top center, a glowing marquee panel displays "GEVA KIPPER" in bold, pixelated LED-style lettering with animated light-bulb borders cycling through cyan, magenta, and yellow. Directly below, in smaller retro digital font, appears "Building innovative tools at Google" followed by an even smaller subtitle in a flickering CRT-style text: "This portfolio regenerates daily through AI â€” a new design every 24 hours."

The main cabinet screen occupies the central 70% of the viewport, rendered as a slightly curved CRT monitor with authentic scanline effects and a gentle screen glare. Inside this screen, six game cartridge slots are arranged in a 2x3 grid, each styled as a classic arcade game cabinet miniature. Each cartridge glows with its own neon color scheme and features pixel art icons representing the project theme.

**GlglStats cartridge** uses a vibrant green-and-orange palette with animated musical note sprites bouncing in the background. The title appears in a Pac-Man-style font with a small "PLAY" joystick icon. Hovering triggers a mini-animation where compression waves ripple across the background. Clicking expands the cartridge into a full-screen overlay styled like a game "level complete" screen, displaying the project description with arcade-style "ACTION BUTTONS" linking to the site and YouTube video, complete with 8-bit coin-collection sound effects.

**Ahuzat Dibuk cartridge** features a parking lot heat-map visual in red-yellow-green pixels, styled like a Frogger game level. Tiny pixel cars animate moving in and out of parking spots. The expansion overlay presents news links as "BONUS STAGES" with newspaper-style achievement badges and a "PRESS START" button linking to Facebook.

**2D Part Orienting cartridge** displays rotating polygon shapes in cyan wireframe against a black background, reminiscent of vector arcade games like Asteroids. Geometric shapes continuously morph and align themselves. The expanded view presents the algorithm details in a Tron-like grid interface with the link appearing as a glowing geometric portal.

**The Turing Jest cartridge** shows two pixelated robots facing off in a Street Fighter-style versus screen layout, with "ROUND 1: PUNS" displayed above. Speech bubbles with joke symbols pop up alternately. The overlay presents this as a "CHALLENGER APPROACHING" screen with a flashing "INSERT COIN TO PLAY" link button.

**Rhymes of Israel cartridge** features a pixel art Israeli newspaper being transformed by sparkles and comic book-style "POW!" effects. Headlines scroll vertically in Hebrew-style pixels with rhyming patterns highlighted. The expansion shows browser extension details in a comic book panel layout with installation as the "POWER-UP" button.

**Portfolio Website cartridge** creates a recursive effect showing a miniature arcade cabinet within the cabinet, with infinite mirror reflections fading into the distance, all in purple-pink holographic styling. The self-reference link pulses with an ouroboros-style animation.

Below the main screen, a seventh slot sits in the coin return tray area, styled as a "SOCIAL COMBO" panel with three arcade buttons in red, blue, and white. Each button features the respective social media icon in pixel art (GitHub octocat, LinkedIn logo, Facebook 'f') and glows when hovered, making retro button-press clicking sounds.

The cabinet's control panel area at the bottom shows a credit insert slot displaying "AI ARCHITECT: Claude (Anthropic)" in embossed metallic lettering with a subtle reflection effect. To its right, a digital seven-segment display counter shows the elapsed time since October 6, 2025, 01:02:22, formatted as "UPTIME: XXh XXm XXs" with the numbers flipping mechanically every second, accompanied by faint mechanical click sounds.

The entire design uses careful attention to retro details: slight chromatic aberration on text, authentic arcade cabinet wood grain textures on the borders, worn joystick and button graphics, coin slot reflections, and even a subtle "out of order" sign that briefly flickers across random cartridges before disappearing, adding playful unpredictability to the experience.
