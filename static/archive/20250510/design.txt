# Virtual Code Editor Portfolio Design for Geva Kipper

## Central Concept
A full-screen interactive code editor that mimics a modern IDE like VS Code. The entire portfolio is presented as a coding workspace where visitors can actually edit, run, and experiment with sample code from Geva's projects.

## Layout

### Header Area
- Top bar resembling a code editor's menu bar with Geva Kipper's name styled as a filename tab
- Below his name, a single elegant sentence describing his current work at Google
- A subtle animated subtitle that appears like a comment in code: "// This site redesigns itself daily using AI - what you see today will evolve tomorrow"
- Editor-style controls (theme switcher, font size, etc.) that actually function

### Main Workspace
The main content area divided into two primary panels:

#### Left Panel: Project Explorer
- Styled like a code editor's file explorer
- Five collapsible project folders:
  1. GlglStats
  2. Ahuzat Dibuk
  3. 2D Part Orienting
  4. Meta Portfolio
  5. Connect

#### Right Panel: Code Viewing/Editing Area
When a project is selected from the explorer, its content loads in the main panel as actual runnable code files with:
- Syntax highlighting
- Line numbers
- Minimap on the right side
- Terminal panel at the bottom that can actually run the code samples

### Project Content Views
Each project, when clicked, expands to show:
- README.md file that describes the project
- Sample code files that visitors can actually edit and run
- Media panel showing screenshots, videos, or links
- All links to external resources (YouTube, news articles, etc.)

### Interactive Elements
- When hovering over code, tooltips appear with explanations
- Visitors can modify the code and run it to see results in the terminal
- A "reset code" button if visitors want to return to the original
- Code changes persist during the session using localStorage

### Bottom Panel
- Terminal/console area with:
  - Social links styled as shell commands (github, linkedin, facebook)
  - A running stopwatch displayed as a process timer since 2025-05-10 01:04:04
  - Credit to the AI designer shown as a commented line in the console

## Visual Style
- Dark mode by default (with light mode toggle)
- Color scheme inspired by popular code editor themes like Monokai or Dracula
- Monospaced fonts for code sections
- Subtle animations for transitions between projects
- Code typing animation when first loading a project
- Glowing cursor effect in editable areas

## Technical Notes
- Responsive design that adapts the IDE concept to mobile by transforming into a mobile code editor view
- Actual functioning code editor using Monaco Editor or CodeMirror
- Small particle effect in background representing "code compilation" when running samples
- Audio feedback (subtle keyboard sounds) when typing in the editor
