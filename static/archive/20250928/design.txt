### **Portfolio Website Design: "The Geva Kipper Journey"**

**Overall Concept:**
The website is a single-page, side-scrolling 2D platformer game. The user does not control the character with keys; instead, scrolling down the page moves the character forward along a path, revealing the "levels" of Geva's career. The aesthetic is clean and modern, using vector graphics with a dark, tech-noir theme, accented by vibrant neon glows. The background is a deep navy or black, filled with subtly animated elements like floating code snippets and pulsating geometric shapes.

**Initial View (The "Start Screen"):**
Upon loading, the screen shows a stylized, 2D vector character representing Geva Kipper. He stands at the beginning of a glowing, light-blue path that stretches to the right and disappears off-screen. The background is a starry cosmos where constellations are shaped like code symbols (`</>`, `{}`, `=>`).

*   **Main Title:** `Geva Kipper` is displayed prominently in a clean, slightly futuristic, mono-spaced font. The text has a subtle, slow-breathing glow effect.
*   **Sentence:** Below the name, in a smaller, crisp font: `Software Engineer at Google, exploring the creative frontiers of AI.`
*   **AI Subtitle:** A separate, smaller line of text with a slight, intermittent "glitch" animation: `This site is a living experiment, its design re-generated by AI daily.`
*   **Call to Action:** An animated, pulsing down-arrow or the text "Scroll to begin the journey" is centered at the bottom, prompting the user to scroll.

**Gameplay & Section Interaction:**
As the user scrolls down, the camera follows the Geva character as he walks along the path. The background and foreground elements move at different speeds (parallax effect) to create depth. At each of the six project milestones, the path leads to an interactive "terminal." The character stops, and a semi-transparent, dark glass panel fades into view. This panel is the project box. Hovering over the panel makes its neon border and title glow brighter.

**Section 1: GlglStats**
*   **Environment:** The path morphs into a flowing musical staff. The background fills with animated, pulsing soundwaves and abstract bar graphs made of light. Musical notes drift lazily in the air.
*   **Project Box:** A terminal with a magenta neon border.
    *   **Title:** `GlglStats`
    *   **Description:** A Python project measuring the repetitiveness of Israeli pop songs using LZ77 compression, with visualizations of repetition patterns.
    *   **Buttons:** Two glowing magenta buttons: `View Project` (links to glglstats.geekip.dev) and `Watch PYDATA Talk` (links to the YouTube video).

**Section 2: Ahuzat Dibuk**
*   **Environment:** The path transitions into a stylized city grid/map. The background shows a dark, abstract Tel Aviv skyline. Animated heat-map patterns (red, orange, green) pulse over the background cityscape.
*   **Project Box:** A terminal with a warm orange neon border.
    *   **Title:** `Ahuzat Dibuk`
    *   **Description:** A Python scraping project that visualizes parking lot occupancy in Tel Aviv with generated heat-maps for residents.
    *   **Links:** Three glowing orange buttons: `As seen on 13TV`, `Mako News Story`, and `Original Facebook Post`.

**Section 3: 2D Part Orienting**
*   **Environment:** The path becomes a series of sharp, geometric lines and angles, reminiscent of a blueprint. The background is filled with slowly rotating, wireframe polygons in a 3D space.
*   **Project Box:** A terminal with a cyan neon border.
    *   **Title:** `2D Part Orienting`
    *   **Description:** C++ implementation of an efficient algorithm for constructing a 'push plan' to orient a polygon, contributed to an open-source computational geometry library.
    *   **Button:** A single glowing cyan button: `Code & Project Details` (links to the TAU project page).

**Section 4: The Turing Jest**
*   **Environment:** The path leads onto a stage with a single spotlight. The background is a dark, empty comedy club. Faint letters spelling "HA HA HA" gently fall like rain.
*   **Project Box:** A terminal with a bright green neon border.
    *   **Title:** `The Turing Jest`
    *   **Description:** An LLM arena where AI models compete to create and explain puns, rated by users.
    *   **Button:** A glowing green button: `Enter The Arena` (links to jest.geekip.dev).

**Section 5: Rhymes of Israel**
*   **Environment:** The path looks like an unspooling roll of newspaper. The background is a moving collage of blurred Hebrew news headlines. Occasionally, a headline animates, twisting itself into a rhyming couplet before fading.
*   **Project Box:** A terminal with a deep blue neon border, featuring a small Chrome logo icon next to the title.
    *   **Title:** `Rhymes of Israel`
    *   **Description:** A Chrome extension rewriting Israeli news headlines into comedic rhymes using an LLM, in the style of a high-school yearbook.
    *   **Button:** A glowing blue button: `Install Extension` (links to the Chrome Web Store).

**Section 6: The Portfolio (Meta)**
*   **Environment:** The path fractures and de-rezzes into lines of code. The background becomes a wireframe view of the very website the user is on, with the Geva character now standing outside the "game," observing it.
*   **Project Box:** A terminal with a shimmering, rainbow-colored neon border.
    *   **Title:** `This Website`
    *   **Description:** A meta-project: a single-page portfolio designed as a 2D platformer, generated by an AI.
    *   **Button:** A glowing, rainbow-colored button: `View Domain` (links to geekip.dev).

**Final Section & Footer**
The path ends on a final floating platform. The Geva character stands there, looking out at the code-constellation cosmos.

*   **Social Links Box:** Below the final platform, there is no description, just three large, minimalist, glowing white icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook, which link to the respective profiles.
*   **Footer Bar:** At the absolute bottom of the page is a static, dark grey footer.
    *   **Left Side:** `Design generated by a large language model.`
    *   **Right Side:** A label `Time Since Genesis:` followed by a ticking digital stopwatch in `HH:MM:SS` format, counting up from `2025-09-28 01:08:13`.
