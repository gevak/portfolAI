**Visual Concept: The "System Paradox" 404**

**Overall Aesthetic & Vibe**
The website should mimic a high-fidelity "Blue Screen of Death" (BSOD) or a terminal system failure, but reimagined as an elegant, intentional Brutalist art piece. The background logic is that the "Portfolio" file was missing, so the system (the AI) improvised by constructing a temporary interface out of raw memory dumps.

The color palette should be deep obsidian black (#0a0a0a) combined with "Terminal Green" and "Error Red" accents, but softened with a glassmorphism effect to ensure it feels modern, not retro-kitsch. A subtle CRT scanline overlay should flicker occasionally across the screen. The mouse cursor should be replaced by a blinking underscore block `_`.

**Header Section: The Glitch**
The top of the page features a massive, typographic element reading "404" that spans the entire width. However, the "0" is glitching and morphing into a circular profile picture or a geometric abstraction of the developer's face. 

Overlaid on this chaotic background is pristine, high-contrast white text:
*   **Headline:** "Geva Kipper" (San-serif, bold).
*   **Tagline:** "Software Engineer currently building infrastructure at Google." (Monospace font, appearing as if being typed out in real-time).
*   **The AI Disclaimer:** Below the name, a small status bar pulsing in amber light reads: *"System Alert: Layout regenerated daily by AI. Iteration #249. Entropy level: High."*

**The Grid: "Recovered Memory Blocks"**
The main content area is not a standard grid, but a masonry layout styled to look like floating "debug windows" or fragmented memory blocks. Each box has a semi-transparent, frosted-glass background with a thin, glowing border. Upon hovering, the border color shifts from white to neon green, and the card scales up slightly, creating a "data recovered" effect.

*   **Block 1: GlglStats (The Audio Visualizer)**
    *   **Visual:** The background of this card features a subtle, animated distinct bar-chart pattern that mimics an audio equalizer.
    *   **Content:** Title "GlglStats" in bold. Description text about Python and LZ77 compression.
    *   **Actions:** Two distinct pill-shaped buttons. One labeled "Run Analysis" (Link to site) and one with a "Play" icon labeled "PyData Conference" (Link to YouTube).

*   **Block 2: Ahuzat Dibuk (The Urban Heatmap)**
    *   **Visual:** A stylized, monochromatic map of Tel Aviv serves as the card's watermark. Red "heat" dots pulse slowly in the background.
    *   **Content:** Title "Ahuzat Dibuk." Description of the scraping and parking visualization.
    *   **Actions:** A "News Coverage" cluster containing links to Channel 13 and Mako, and a generic "Source" link for the Facebook post.

*   **Block 3: 2D Part Orienting (The Geometry)**
    *   **Visual:** A wireframe polygon rotates slowly in 3D space within the card.
    *   **Content:** Title "2D Part Orienting." Text regarding C++ and computational geometry.
    *   **Action:** A button labeled "View Repository" linking to the project page.

*   **Block 4: The Turing Jest (The Chat Interface)**
    *   **Visual:** The layout resembles a split-screen chat log between two bots.
    *   **Content:** Title "The Turing Jest." Explanation of the LLM pun arena.
    *   **Action:** A button labeled "Enter Arena" linking to the site.

*   **Block 5: Rhymes of Israel (The Newspaper)**
    *   **Visual:** The typography in this card changes to an Old English/Newspaper header font for the title, contrasting with the rest of the site.
    *   **Content:** Title "Rhymes of Israel." Description of the comedic Chrome extension.
    *   **Action:** A button styled like a browser extension badge labeled "Add to Chrome."

*   **Block 6: Recursion Error (The Portfolio)**
    *   **Visual:** An "Infinity Mirror" effect. The background of this card is a screenshot of the website itself, which contains a smaller screenshot of the website, ad infinitum.
    *   **Content:** Title "Self-Reference." A meta-humor description about the site appearing in the site.
    *   **Action:** A link to "geekip.dev" that triggers a quirky animation (like a screen shake) before reloading the page.

*   **Block 7: Connectivity Protocols (Socials)**
    *   This is a horizontal bar spanning the width of the grid bottom.
    *   It resembles a server rack faceplate.
    *   The links to GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook are styled as physical graphical ports (USB, Ethernet, HDMI symbols) that "plug in" when clicked.

**Footer: The Temporal Glitch**
The bottom of the page features a "System Diagnostics" footer in small monospace text.

*   **Credits:** "Architected by AI Model [Model Name]."
*   **The Stopwatch:** Since the requested reference start time (2026-01-07) is in the future relative to the current time, this element leans into the sci-fi theme. It is labeled **"TEMPORAL OVERFLOW ERROR."**
*   **Mechanism:** The counter displays a negative countdown (e.g., "- 8990h 22m 10s") representing the time *until* the designated glitch date, effectively counting up towards zero (the singularity). The seconds flicker erratically to suggest time dilation.
