# April Fools Portfolio Design for Geva Kipper

## Overall Concept
A minimalist website with a playful twist that initially appears to showcase bizarre, outlandish joke projects. When users interact with each project (hover or click), the content humorously transforms to reveal Geva's actual impressive portfolio pieces.

## Color Scheme & Typography
- Primary palette: Clean whites and light grays with accents of pastel colors that evoke a lighthearted, April Fools vibe
- Typography: Sans-serif for readability, with occasional "glitchy" text transitions when revealing real projects
- Subtle confetti animation triggers when a fake project transforms to real

## Header Section
Bold, centered header with "GEVA KIPPER" and an elegant subtitle mentioning his current work at Google. Below this, a smaller italic text explaining the AI-generated nature of the site that changes daily.

## Project Display
Four uniformly sized cards in a 2Ã—2 grid (responsive to single column on mobile) with smooth hover effects:

1. **Fake Project**: "KittenScript" - A programming language where all syntax is replaced with cat sounds
   **Real Project (revealed)**: GlglStats with appropriate description, link, and embedded video thumbnail

2. **Fake Project**: "Parking Psychic" - An app claiming to predict parking spots using zodiac signs
   **Real Project (revealed)**: Ahuzat Dibuk with news links and description

3. **Fake Project**: "Quantum Resume" - A portfolio that exists in multiple states simultaneously
   **Real Project (revealed)**: Meta portfolio site with self-reference

4. **Fake Project**: "Social Media Time Machine" - Links to fictional profiles from the future
   **Real Project (revealed)**: Actual social media links with appropriate icons

## Interaction Effects
- Hovering over a project causes it to "glitch" slightly
- Clicking a project triggers a comical transformation animation (paper fold, spinning reveal, or digital "error" effect)
- Small confetti burst when the real project is revealed

## Footer
Elegant, minimal footer with AI credit and a retro-digital stopwatch counting time since April 1, 2025, with a subtle ticking effect.

## Special Features
- Easter egg: Konami code input triggers a full-screen April Fools joke
- Subtle paper airplane that flies across screen occasionally
- Light/dark mode toggle shaped like a jester's hat

## Animations
All transitions between fake and real projects use playful but professional animations that maintain the site's elegant feel while embracing the April Fools theme.
