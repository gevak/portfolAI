# Neural Network Portfolio Design Concept

## Site Theme: Interactive Neural Network Visualization

The site features an animated neural network visualization as the background, with glowing nodes and connections that respond to cursor movement. As visitors move their cursor across the screen, neural pathways light up and activate in the direction of movement, creating a sense of the visitor "training" the network through interaction.

## Header Section
A minimalist header with "GEVA KIPPER" in a bold, modern sans-serif font that appears to be constructed from neural network nodes. Underneath, a single sentence: "Building AI-powered experiences at Google that transform how humans and machines interact."

Below this, a subtle animated subtitle that fades in: "This portfolio is reimagined daily through AI - what you see today won't exist tomorrow."

## Main Content Layout
The five project sections appear as interconnected network clusters, initially appearing as abstract node groupings. As the user scrolls or hovers, these nodes reorganize themselves into clear content boxes with a soft glow effect.

## Project Sections
Each project box has a distinct neural pattern and color scheme:

1. **GlglStats**: Visualization with waveform patterns resembling audio frequencies. The nodes pulse rhythmically, suggesting music analysis. Contains project description, links to the live site and PyData TLV video embedded as a node that expands on hover.

2. **Ahuzat Dibuk**: Features a heat-map inspired neural pattern that shifts from blue to red based on density. Contains project description and links to news coverage and Facebook publication.

3. **2D Part Orienting**: Shows geometric shapes being manipulated by neural connections, visually demonstrating the polygon orientation concept. Links to the computational geometry library.

4. **Portfolio Website**: Meta-visualization showing a smaller version of the same neural network design the visitor is currently experiencing. Self-referential animation that loops into itself, with a link to the rendered version.

5. **Social Links**: Three distinct neural clusters that transform into the GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook logos when activated, with appropriate links.

## Interaction Details
- As users scroll, neural connections between sections activate and light up, creating a path through the portfolio
- When hovering over projects, the neural network reorganizes to emphasize the selected content
- Clicking a project causes a cascade effect where nodes expand to reveal full project details
- Subtle particle effects follow cursor movement, suggesting neural activation

## Footer
A minimalist footer with credit text: "Design generated by Claude AI" and an elegant digital stopwatch displaying time elapsed since May 2, 2025, with glowing digits that pulse softly.

## Color Scheme & Typography
- Primary background: Deep navy/black gradient suggesting the depths of a neural network
- Accent colors: Electric blue, purple, and teal for neural connections
- Typography: Clean sans-serif font for readability, with variable weight to emphasize important information
- Text appears to assemble itself from nearby nodes when sections come into view

## Responsive Behavior
On mobile devices, the neural network simplifies but remains interactive through touch, with project sections stacking vertically while maintaining their unique neural identity.
