# YouTube Creator Studio Meets Neon Cinema

The page opens with a dark charcoal background (#1a1a1a) reminiscent of YouTube's dark mode, but with a cinematic twist. At the top, a sleek header bar spans the full width in deep red (#CC0000) with subtle gradient to darker crimson, mimicking YouTube's brand but feeling more sophisticated. On the left side of this bar, the name "Geva Kipper" appears in bold, white Roboto font (YouTube's signature typeface) at 32px, with a small red "LIVE" indicator dot pulsing next to it. Directly beneath the name, in 14px gray text, reads: "Building developer tools at Google." 

Below this, centered on the red bar, is the subtitle in italic, light gray text (16px): "This portfolio regenerates daily through AI â€” you're viewing today's edition" with a small sparkle emoji animation that subtly glitters every few seconds.

The main content area presents a grid layout inspired by YouTube's video thumbnail grid, but with a 2-3-2 arrangement: two boxes in the first row, three in the middle row, two in the third row. Each project box is designed as a YouTube video card with a 16:9 aspect ratio thumbnail area at the top, followed by a dark gray (#2a2a2a) description panel below.

For **GlglStats**, the thumbnail shows a dynamic visualization: animated Hebrew letters compress and expand in a loop, with colored bars representing LZ77 compression ratios pulsing rhythmically. A red "PLAY" button overlay appears on hover. The title "GlglStats: The Science of Earworms" appears below in white 18px bold text. Underneath, in smaller gray text: "347K views â€¢ PyData TLV 2024". Two clickable chips appear below: a rounded red button labeled "WATCH TALK â†’" and a darker outlined button "EXPLORE SITE â†’". A small PyData logo badge sits in the bottom right corner.

**Ahuzat Dibuk** features a thumbnail displaying an animated heat-map of Tel Aviv that shifts from blue (empty lots) to red (full) in a breathing pattern. The title reads "Ahuzat Dibuk: Parking Lot Oracle" with "892K views â€¢ Featured on Channel 13 News" below. Three pill-shaped buttons stack vertically in the description: "ðŸ“º Channel 13", "ðŸ“º Mako News", "ðŸ’¬ Facebook Post", each with a slight hover lift effect.

**2D Part Orienting** presents a geometric animation in the thumbnail: a polygon rotating and being "pushed" by invisible force arrows into different orientations, drawn in bright cyan (#00ffff) against black. The title "2D Part Orienting: Computational Geometry in Action" uses a more technical monospace font. Below: "15K views â€¢ Academic Research â€¢ C++". A single blue outlined button reads "VIEW RESEARCH â†’".

**The Turing Jest** thumbnail shows two chat bubbles facing each other like fighters in a ring, with little "HA HA" text particles floating upward in yellow and pink. The background has a subtle spotlight effect. Title: "The Turing Jest: AI Comedy Battle Royale" with "2.1M views â€¢ Try it yourself!" below. A bright yellow rounded button invites: "ENTER THE ARENA â†’" with a laugh-cry emoji.

**Rhymes of Israel** displays a split-screen thumbnail: left side shows a serious Hebrew news headline, right side shows the same headline transformed into playful rhyming text with doodle decorations around it. Title: "Rhymes of Israel: News, But Make It Yearbook" with "156K views â€¢ Chrome Extension â€¢ Hebrew". A green "ADD TO CHROME â†’" button with the Chrome logo sits below.

**geekip.dev** (the meta portfolio entry) features an Escher-like infinite loop thumbnail: a screen showing a screen showing a screen, with tiny "HELLO WORLD" text cascading into infinity. Rainbow colored subtle outline. Title: "geekip.dev: The Recursion Edition" with "âˆž views â€¢ You are here". The button is grayed out and reads "ALREADY WATCHING" with a winking emoji.

The seventh box breaks the video card pattern entirely. It's a slim horizontal bar (full width of two cards) in slightly lighter gray (#333333), labeled "SUBSCRIBE TO MY CHANNELS" in YouTube-style all-caps. Three large circular icon buttons sit centered: GitHub (white cat logo), LinkedIn (blue), Facebook (blue), each with the platform logo and subtle shadow. On hover, each grows slightly and shows the handle below: "gevak", "gevakip", "geva.kipper".

At the very bottom, a footer bar in black (#0a0a0a) contains two elements: on the left, in small gray text (11px): "Designed and coded by Claude (Anthropic) â€¢ AI-generated portfolio â€¢ Today's theme: Neon Cinema" and on the right, a digital stopwatch display in red LED-style font showing "TIME SINCE LAST DEPLOY: XXd XXh XXm XXs" counting up from 2025-10-31 01:05:05.

Subtle animations throughout: video thumbnails have a gentle Ken Burns zoom effect on hover, all buttons have smooth color transitions, and occasional particle effects (small colored dots) drift upward from random positions on the page like YouTube confetti celebrations. The entire page has a subtle film grain overlay at 3% opacity for texture.
