### Website Design: The "Single File" Portfolio

**Overall Concept:**

The entire website is designed to look like a single, elegant code file named `geva_kipper_portfolio.js` being viewed in a modern, dark-themed code editor. The user doesn't navigate pages; they simply scroll down through the "code." All the content—the text, project descriptions, and links—is presented within structured comment blocks (`/** ... */`). The layout is clean, text-focused, and uses syntax highlighting as a primary design element to create a visually rich experience.

**Visual Theme & Layout:**

The background is a deep charcoal or navy blue, mimicking a popular IDE like VS Code's "Dark+" theme. On the far left, a static, light-grey gutter displays line numbers running down the page, reinforcing the code file illusion. The main content is contained within a central column, with generous padding on either side. The font for the entire site is a modern monospaced font with ligatures, like Fira Code or JetBrains Mono.

When the page first loads, the text animates as if being typed out line-by-line at high speed, from top to bottom, settling within a couple of seconds. This creates a dynamic "just generated" feeling, supporting the AI theme.

**Header Section:**

The site begins at line 1. A large, multi-line JSDoc-style comment block (`/** ... */`) serves as the header.

*   **`@author` Tag:** The first line inside the comment displays "Geva Kipper" in a bright, prominent color (like a class name in code, e.g., turquoise or light green).
*   **`@description` Tag:** The next line contains the sentence about his work at Google, styled as a plain comment string (e.g., white or light grey).
*   **`@version` Tag:** This line presents the subtitle. The text "This portfolio is re-designed each day by AI and is thus ever-changing" is styled in an italicized, muted color (e.g., slate grey), with the word "AI" highlighted in a different color, like magenta or orange, to draw the eye.

```css
/**
 * @author:  Geva Kipper
 * @desc:    [Single sentence explaining current work at Google.]
 * @version: This portfolio is re-designed each day by AI and is thus ever-changing.
 */
```

**Projects Grid:**

Below the header comment, a fictional JavaScript constant is declared, like `const projects = [`. The six project sections are presented as objects within this array. They are arranged in a responsive two-column grid to keep the page from becoming too long. Each project "box" is not a box at all, but another JSDoc-style comment block (`/** ... */`) followed by a stylized function name. The comment block has a slightly lighter background shade than the main editor, making it stand out as a distinct section.

For each project:
*   The project title is on a `@title` line, rendered in a bold, vibrant color.
*   The description follows on a `@summary` line.
*   Links are presented as `@link` tags. The link text (e.g., "Live Site," "Video Presentation," "News Story") is styled like a code parameter, and the URL itself is styled as a clickable string literal (e.g., in a green color, wrapped in single quotes). Hovering over a link adds an underline.

Example for Project 1:

```javascript
/**
 * @title    GlglStats
 * @summary  A Python project measuring the repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs
 *           based on LZ77 compression, with visualizations of song patterns.
 * @link     Live Site: 'https://glglstats.geekip.dev'
 * @link     PyData Talk: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo'
 */
const showcase_GlglStats = () => {};
```

The video link for 'GlglStats' opens in a modal pop-up that has the aesthetic of a terminal window, with the YouTube video embedded inside, keeping the user within the portfolio's environment. The sixth project, "This Portfolio," has its link styled in a unique, cyclical way—perhaps with an animated, glowing effect—to emphasize its meta-nature.

**Social & Contact Section:**

After the project grid, a new constant is declared, `const contactInfo = {`. This section consists of a single wide block, styled like the project blocks. The links to GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook are presented as key-value pairs within the "object." The keys ("github", "linkedin", "facebook") are styled one color, and the string-literal-style links are another.

```javascript
/**
 * @connect  Let's get in touch.
 */
const socialLinks = {
    github:   'https://github.com/gevak',
    linkedin: 'https://linkedin.com/in/gevakip',
    facebook: 'https://facebook.com/geva.kipper'
};
```

**Footer & Credit:**

At the very bottom of the "file," a final, single-line comment appears: `// EOF`. Below this, a small, centered footer section contains two elements. First, a line of text in a subtle, grey, italicized font: `/* Designed and generated on-the-fly by a friendly Large Language Model */`.

Directly below that is the stopwatch. It's presented clearly with the label `SESSION UPTIME:` followed by the live-updating timer in the site's primary monospaced font, showing `HH:MM:SS` ticking upwards from the specified start time. This final, dynamic element solidifies the concept of a live, ever-running, and freshly generated site.
