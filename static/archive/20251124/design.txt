**Global Aesthetic & Atmosphere:**
The website features a "Dark Mode" Cyberpunk-Gym aesthetic. The background is a deep, matte charcoal (#121212) representing a terminal window, while accents are neon green (referencing successful unit tests) and metallic chrome (referencing physical iron). The typography is a mix of bold, industrial sans-serif for headers (resembling gym equipment branding) and a crisp monospaced font for project descriptions (resembling code).

**The "Scroll-Lift" Mechanic:**
The central visual element is a stylized, vector-illustrated avatar of **Geva Kipper** centered at the bottom of the viewport. The avatar is positioned in a "squat" stance, holding a massive, glowing barbell that stretches horizontally across the screen. The barbell bar itself is designed to look like a raw text-input field or a command line.

The website does not scroll normally. Instead, it utilizes **scroll-jacking**. As the user scrolls down (or swipes up), the background remains static, but massive "Weight Plates"—which represent the project sections—descend from the top of the screen and slot onto the barbell. With every scroll increment, the avatar physically strains (animated using CSS transforms or Sprites), shaking slightly to simulate the immense "backend load" of the projects. The more projects the user views, the heavier the visual load becomes, symbolizing the developer's computational strength.

**Header Section (The Setup):**
Floating in the negative space above the avatar’s head (before any weights drop) is the title text in large, monolithic lettering: **GEVA KIPPER**.
Below the name, a sleek tooltip-style badge reads: *"Software Engineer at Google."*
Just beneath that, in a glitch-text animation style (flickering slightly), is the subtitle: *"This website is re-designed each day by AI and is thus ever-changing."*

**The Project "Weight Plates" (Content Sections):**
Each project is represented as a heavy, industrial rectangular block that slides down the guide rails on the left and right sides of the screen. As a new block locks into place, the previous one fades into the background stack. Each block features a specific design theme:

1.  **GlglStats (The Compression Plate):**
    *   **Visual:** The box has a hydraulic press aesthetic. To the right of the text, a dynamic animated equalizers visualizes the "LZ77 compression" of pop songs.
    *   **Content:** Title "GlglStats". Description of the Python repetitiveness project.
    *   **CTAs:** A button shaped like a Play icon for the Youtube video, and a "View Data" button for the website link.

2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk (The Maps Plate):**
    *   **Visual:** The background of this block is a dark-mode map of Tel Aviv with heat-map overlays pulsating in red and orange.
    *   **Content:** Title "Ahuzat Dibuk". Description of the parking lot scraping/visualization.
    *   **CTAs:** Three buttons styled as "News Ticker" items linking to Channel 13, Mako, and the original Facebook post.

3.  **2D Part Orienting (The Geometry Plate):**
    *   **Visual:** This block features a wire frame background. A simple polygon rotates and snaps into alignment repeatedly in the corner, visualizing the "push plan" algorithm.
    *   **Content:** Title "2D Part Orienting". Description of the C++ computational geometry library implementation.
    *   **CTAs:** A "Source Code" button linking to the project page.

4.  **The Turing Jest (The Arena Plate):**
    *   **Visual:** Split down the middle, styled like a sophisticated fighting game character select screen. One side represents a pun, the other an explanation.
    *   **Content:** Title "The Turing Jest". Description of the LMSYS-like LLM pun competition.
    *   **CTAs:** A "Enter Arena" button linking to the site.

5.  **Rhymes of Israel (The Newspaper Plate):**
    *   **Visual:** The texture looks like crumpled newspaper print, but the headlines actively animate, morphing from standard Hebrew text into rhyming couplets.
    *   **Content:** Title "Rhymes of Israel". Description of the Chrome extension rewritng news into yearbook rhymes.
    *   **CTAs:** A "Add to Chrome" button styled like the Chrome Web Store badge.

6.  **Portfolio Meta-Project (The Mirror Plate):**
    *   **Visual:** The most surreal plate. It features a "Droste effect" (infinite mirror) visual of the website itself, recursively shrinking into infinity.
    *   **Content:** Title "The Recursive Portfolio". A meta-description that you are currently viewing this project.
    *   **CTAs:** A button labeled "Recursion" linking to geekip.dev.

**Footer (The Cool Down):**
Once the final "weight" is lifted, the avatar locks the barbell overhead in a triumph pose. The floor of the screen slides up to reveal the footer info:
*   **Social Rack:** Three recognizable icons (GitHub, LinkedIn, Facebook) hanging on a gym equipment rack.
*   **The Timer:** A large, red digital LED stopwatch display (like a CrossFit gym timer). It actively counts up in real-time (H:M:S) calculating the duration since **2025-11-24 01:10:40**.
*   **Credits:** Small, monospace text at the very bottom center: *"Site architecture and design generated by AI Model."*
