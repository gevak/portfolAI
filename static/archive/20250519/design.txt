# Portfolio Website Design Concept: Live Coding Typewriter

## Core Concept
A dark-themed, terminal-inspired single page portfolio showcasing Geva Kipper's software engineering skills through a typewriter effect that mimics live coding. The site should feel like watching someone code in real-time, with commands being typed and executed before the visitor's eyes.

## Header Section
The page begins with a terminal-like header showing a blinking cursor. The typewriter effect begins typing:
```
$ whoami
> Geva Kipper, Software Engineer at Google working on advanced machine learning applications.
```

Immediately after, a subtitle appears with another typewriter effect:
```
$ AI_redesign_status
> This website is automatically re-designed each day by AI and is thus ever-changing.
> Today's version: [current date]
```

## Navigation
A minimalist navigation appears as a command line interface:
```
$ ls projects/
> 1_GlglStats/  2_AhuzatDibuk/  3_2D_Part_Orienting/  4_This_Website/  5_Connect/
```
When hovering over each option, a subtle glow effect highlights the selection.

## Project Sections
Each project section appears as if the user typed:
```
$ cat projects/[project_name]/README.md
```

The five project sections are displayed as terminal windows with syntax-highlighted code snippets relevant to each project. Each section has:

1. A terminal title bar with the project name
2. A brief description that types out with the typewriter effect
3. Animated code snippets or visualizations that demonstrate the project
4. Links styled as terminal commands (e.g., `$ open https://glglstats.onrender.com/`)

## Project-Specific Features
1. **GlglStats**: Include an animated visualization of sound waves or LZ77 compression happening in real-time. Show snippets of Python code with syntax highlighting.

2. **Ahuzat Dibuk**: Display an interactive heat map of Tel Aviv parking lots that visitors can hover over to see occupancy data. Include newspaper screenshots that expand when clicked.

3. **2D Part Orienting**: Show an animated SVG of the polygon orientation algorithm in action. Include C++ code with proper syntax highlighting.

4. **This Website**: Meta-section showing the actual code powering the typewriter effect on this very site. When visitors hover, the code updates in real-time.

5. **Connect**: Social links appear as a terminal directory listing:
   ```
   $ ls ~/contact/
   > GitHub/  LinkedIn/  Facebook/
   ```
   Clicking each one types out a command like `$ open github.com/gevak` before redirecting.

## Interactive Elements
- Visitors can type certain commands in a persistent terminal at the bottom of the page to navigate or reveal Easter eggs
- When hovering over any section, the cursor changes to a terminal cursor
- Scrolling between sections triggers new "commands" to be typed
- A subtle terminal "glow" effect on all text to mimic old CRT monitors

## Footer
The footer displays:
```
$ credits
> Generated by [AI Model Name] on [generation date]
$ uptime
> Running for [time elapsed since 2025-05-19 01:10:23]
```
The uptime counter updates in real-time with a blinking effect.

## Visual Design
- Color scheme: Dark terminal background (#0C0C0C) with green (#00FF00), amber (#FFBF00), and white (#FFFFFF) text
- Font: Monospace font like JetBrains Mono or Fira Code with ligatures enabled
- Subtle scan line effect over the entire site to enhance the terminal aesthetic
- Minimal use of borders - separation mainly through spacing and background shade differences
- Smooth animations for all transitions, with careful timing to make the typing feel realistic

## Responsive Behavior
On mobile, the terminal appearance remains, but the layout adjusts to a vertical orientation with a toggleable command line interface for navigation.
