**Visual Concept: The Infernal Ledger**

The website should be designed to resemble an ancient, interactive legal scroll or a "terms of service" document from the underworld, floating on a dark, textured background representing a wooden desk or a distinct void. The color palette should utilize deep charcoal (`#121212`) for the background, unbleached parchment beige (`#f0e6d2`) for the document container, and accents of "dried ink" black and "sealing wax" crimson (`#8a0303`). The typography must mix high-legibility serif fonts (like *Merriweather* or *Crimson Text*) for body text with sharp, Gothic display fonts (like *Unifraktur* or *Cinzel*) for headers to evoke a sense of binding magical legality.

**Header and Introduction: The Preamble**

The top of the document should not read "Portfolio," but rather "USER AGREEMENT & SOUL BINDING CONTRACT." Below this, center-aligned, display the developer's name, **Geva Kipper**, styled as the "Party of the First Part." Directly underneath, include his bio line: *"Software Engineer at Google, currently architecting the digital ether."* The subtitle regarding the AI redesign should appear as a stamped warning in red ink, slightly tilted: *"NOTICE: This interface is hallucinations-prone, re-generated daily by AI. Terms are subject to mutability."* The "Accept Cookies" concept is the core interaction: a sticky footer or floating quill icon should constantly prompt the user to "Sign & Accept All" throughout the scroll.

**The Grid: The Six Clauses**

The main content area is a CSS Grid layout formatted as "Articles" of the contract. Each box should be a card styled with heavy borders that look like hand-drawn ink lines. Hovering over a box should cause a "singe" effect, where the edges glow slightly orange, as if the paper is burning.

1.  **Article I: The GlglStats Oscillator**
    Embed the YouTube video of the PyData conference talk, but style the iframe with a jagged edge to look like a torn piece of photograph attached to the file. The text should describe the Python/LZ77 analysis of pop-chart repetitiveness. Include a prominent CTA button styled as a wax seal that links to the project site.

2.  **Article II: The Possession of Ahuzat Dibuk**
    This section should feature a background texture of a faint, low-opacity heatmap. The text explains the scraper and visualizations for Tel-Aviv parking. The links to the news stories (Channel 13, Mako) and the Facebook post should be styled as "Exhibits A, B, and C," listed in a formal, bulleted list with external link icons that look like small daggers.

3.  **Article III: Geometric Containment (2D Part Orienting)**
    Use a background of faint technical schematics or geometric diagrams. Describe the C++ implementation and the push plan algorithm. The link to the project code should be labeled "Inspect The Blueprint."

4.  **Article IV: The Jester’s Court (The Turing Jest)**
    This box should have a slightly more chaotic layout, perhaps with the title tilted. Describe the LLM arena for puns. The link to the site should be a playful button saying "Enter the Arena."

5.  **Article V: The Rhyme Weaver (Rhymes of Israel)**
    This section needs to look like a newspaper clipping pasted onto the scroll. Describe the Chrome extension that rewrites headlines. The link to the Chrome Web Store should be styled to look like an official "Install Hex" button.

6.  **Article VI: The Ouroboros (Meta Portfolio)**
    This box represents recursion. It should include a small, recursive screenshot of the site itself (or a wireframe icon). The text explains this is the current site. The link to `geekip.dev` should be labeled "Refresh the Contract."

**The Signatories (Socials)**

Below the grid, create a section titled "Witnesses & Affiliations." Instead of standard icons, use "wax stamp" versions of the GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook logos. They should be arranged horizontally, connected by a calligraphy flourish line.

**Footer: The Timekeeper**

The bottom of the page should fade into a darker "burnt" texture. In small, monospace type, state: *"This site was architected by an Artificial Intelligence model."* Below this, prominently feature a digital stopwatch rooted in the specific timestamp provided. The stopwatch should not be a standard digital clock but should look like rolling mechanical tumblers or a shifting celestial calendar. It must count *up* in Hours:Minutes:Seconds representing time elapsed since **2025-11-23 01:15:02**. (Note: Since this date is in the future relative to current time, the design should handle negative values or imply a countdown to the "Event," or simply display the sheer time difference if the date is treated as a past epoch in the narrative).
