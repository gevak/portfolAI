# Digital Subway Map Portfolio Design for Geva Kipper

## Overall Concept
A digital subway/metro map where each line represents a different skill category (Programming Languages, Frameworks, Data Science, etc.) and stations represent projects and experiences. The entire site is a single page with smooth scrolling and interactive elements that mimic a transit map experience.

## Header
- Large transit-style header with "GEVA KIPPER" in a bold, transit-inspired font
- Subtitle: "Senior Software Engineer at Google, focusing on cloud infrastructure and reliability systems"
- Small animated ticker or digital display showing: "This portfolio is redesigned daily by AI and is ever-changing - today's design generated on [current date]"
- Navigation controls styled as subway line selector buttons in different colors

## Main Map Area
The centerpiece is an interactive subway map with colorful lines:
- Red Line: Programming Projects
- Blue Line: Data Science & Visualization
- Green Line: Computational Geometry
- Yellow Line: Web Development
- Gray Line: Professional Experience

Each project is a "station" on the map, with interchange stations where projects use multiple skills. When hovering over a station, it illuminates and expands slightly.

## Project Stations
Each project station, when clicked, expands into a modal styled like a subway information board:

1. **GlglStats Station**: 
   - Icon of musical notes and code
   - Brief description with terminal-style formatting
   - Two subway-style direction signs: one pointing to "Live Demo" and one to "Conference Talk"

2. **Ahuzat Dibuk Station**:
   - Icon of a parking lot with heat map visualization
   - Media coverage displayed as "connecting routes" with news outlet logos
   - Links styled as "next departure" information

3. **2D Part Orienting Station**:
   - Visual representation of the algorithm with geometric shapes
   - C++ code snippets styled as transit schedule information
   - Link to additional information styled as a transfer ticket

4. **Portfolio Website Station**:
   - Meta station with a recursive subway map icon
   - Self-referential design with an "You Are Here" indicator
   - Link styled as "Return to current location"

5. **Social Connection Hub**:
   - Central interchange station where multiple lines meet
   - Icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook styled as different exit gates
   - Brief hover descriptions for each platform

## Interactive Elements
- Mouse wheel to zoom in/out of the map
- Draggable map interface for exploration
- Line toggle buttons to highlight specific skill categories
- Station-to-station "journey planner" to show connections between projects

## Footer
- Minimal transit-style footer with attribution: "Designed by [AI Model Name]"
- Digital transit clock showing time elapsed since May 7, 2025, 01:06:07 in hours:minutes:seconds
- Easter egg: clicking on the clock reveals a "service announcement" with a fun fact about Geva

## Color & Typography
- Primary colors based on transit maps (strong, accessible colors with good contrast)
- Typography mixing a geometric sans-serif for headings with a more readable font for descriptions
- Thin connecting lines between stations with appropriate curves and angles like a real transit map

## Responsive Behavior
- On mobile, the map transforms into a vertical line diagram
- Stations stack vertically but maintain their connection visuals
- Touch-friendly larger tap targets for mobile users
