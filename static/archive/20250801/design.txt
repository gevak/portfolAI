### Portfolio Design: The Celestial Code

**Opening Scene & Header**

The website opens on a dark, infinite 3D space. The background is a deep indigo, filled with slowly drifting, glowing particle effects resembling digital stardust and distant, faint nebulae made of soft, cyan light. Floating calmly in the center of the view is the name **Geva Kipper** rendered as a clean, solid 3D object with a subtle metallic sheen. Below it, in a smaller, elegant sans-serif font, is a single line of text: "A software engineer at Google developing next-generation infrastructure for large-scale systems."

Directly beneath this, a subtitle softly pulses with a faint glow: "This portfolio is procedurally generated and redesigned by an AI each day. The journey is always new." A quiet, ambient soundscape with gentle electronic hums and twinkles enhances the atmosphere. A small, non-intrusive "Scroll to Explore" indicator hovers at the bottom of the initial view, encouraging the user to begin their journey.

**The Journey & Project Interaction**

As the user begins to scroll, the camera gracefully pushes forward into the 3D space, flying on a smooth, pre-determined cinematic path. The journey is not a straight line; the camera banks, swoops, and pans to navigate between "project nodes." Each node is a distinct, abstract 3D object floating in space, thematically representing the project it holds.

When the camera approaches a node, the corresponding 3D object becomes the focal point, growing larger and rotating gently. Simultaneously, a semi-transparent, dark-glass UI panel animates into view on the left or right side of the screen. This 2D overlay contains the project's title, a concise description, and glowing, interactive buttons for the associated links. The background 3D scene remains visible but slightly blurred and dimmed to keep focus on the information. Scrolling further continues the flight to the next node.

**The Project Nodes**

1.  **GlglStats:** The 3D object for this node is a pulsating waveform of light, resembling a visualization from a music player, contorting into a perfect loop. The UI panel presents the project description, with two glowing buttons: "Visit GlglStats" and "Watch PyData Talk."

2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk:** This node is represented by a 3D wireframe grid of a city map, with certain areas glowing with an orange-to-red heat-map effect. The UI panel details the project and provides three distinct buttons: "13tv News Story," "Mako News Story," and "Original Facebook Post."

3.  **2D Part Orienting:** The camera approaches a complex, crystalline polygon made of clean, white lines. The polygon slowly rotates, its facets catching the ambient light. The UI panel provides the project info and a single button: "View Code & Details."

4.  **The Turing Jest:** This node is a classic comedy mask, but constructed from glowing, digital circuit traces instead of solid material. It winks subtly every few seconds. The UI panel explains the LLM arena concept and features a button labeled "Try The Turing Jest."

5.  **Rhymes of Israel:** The visual is a chrome browser window icon, extruded into 3D. From its center, a quill made of pure light emerges and writes a short, rhyming couplet in the air with a particle trail before it fades and repeats. The panel has one primary call to action: "Install the Chrome Extension."

6.  **The Portfolio (Meta):** This node is a beautiful paradoxâ€”a wireframe cube containing a miniature, simplified, and ghost-like version of the entire portfolio's 3D scene, with a tiny camera endlessly flying through it. The UI panel cheekily describes the meta-project, with a button that says "Return to Start," linked to `geekip.dev`.

**Conclusion & Footer**

After the final project node, the camera continues its flight to a terminal point, a luminous hub where three distinct, glowing icons hover in a triangular formation: the GitHub Octocat, the LinkedIn 'in' logo, and the Facebook 'f'. As the camera settles here, the project UI panel fades away. Clicking on any icon opens the corresponding social profile in a new tab.

As the journey concludes, a minimal footer fades in at the very bottom of the screen, fixed in place. It contains two elements in a small, clean, monospaced font. On the left: "Design by Gemini, an AI by Google." On the right, a live-updating stopwatch with a digital readout, displaying the time elapsed since August 1, 2025, 01:22:22 in H:M:S format, constantly ticking upwards. The ambient sounds fade slightly, leaving the user in a calm, contemplative final state.
