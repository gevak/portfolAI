**Overall Aesthetic and Layout**
The website should be designed as a sleek, modern Integrated Development Environment (IDE) interface seamlessly running in a web browser. The color palette should utilize a high-contrast dark mode—deep charcoal backgrounds (`#1E1E1E`), subtle grid-lines, and bright, neon syntax-highlighting colors (fluorescent pinks, cyan, bright yellow, and lime green). The typography should mix an elegant monospace font (like Fira Code or JetBrains Mono) for the "code" elements, and a clean, modern sans-serif (like Inter) for the reading material to maintain visual elegance. 

**The Initial View: The Code Editor**
When the user lands on the page, the screen resembles a code editor with a single file open, titled `portfolio.js`. 
In the center of the editor, a typing animation writes out the header information as variable declarations and comments:
*   A string variable declaring the Developer's Name: `const buildOwner = "Geva Kipper";`
*   A string variable for the current role: `const currentStatus = "Software Engineer at Google, building next-generation web technologies.";`
*   A multi-line comment acting as the subtitle: `/* NOTE: This layout is dynamically re-designed each day by an AI agent, ensuring an ever-changing digital footprint. */`
Beneath this code block, a prominent, glowing "▶ Run Build Script" button pulses gently, inviting the user to interact.

**The Transition: The "Compiling" Animation**
Upon clicking the "Run" button, a "Terminal" panel slides up from the bottom of the screen. Rapid log messages populate the terminal (e.g., `> Fetching achievements...`, `> Resolving dependencies...`, `> Compiling project modules...`). After a two-second animation ending with `> Build Successful. Rendering UI...`, the terminal visual shatters or morphs. The rigid "code" interface gracefully transitions using CSS animations into an elegant, floating glassmorphism masonry grid. The terminal background dissolves into a soft, glowing, abstract background, revealing the compiled "Achievements." 

**The Compiled Output: The Portfolio Grid (7 Boxes)**
The compiled results are displayed as interactive, translucent "cards" (boxes) hovering over the dark background. Each box has a top bar mimicking an executable file (e.g., `glgl-stats.exe`, `turing-jest.sh`), and the contents within are cleanly structured with sans-serif text, subtle hover animations, and glowing, clickable terminal-style text for the links.

*   **Box 1:** Displays the 'GlglStats' project. The design should feature a miniature visual of a compression-pattern waveform. The text details it as a Python project measuring Israeli pop-chart repetitiveness using LZ77 compression and visualizing repetition patterns. 
    *   *UI Actions:* Two distinct neon-cyan buttons/links. One pointing to the live site (`https://glglstats.geekip.dev`), and another featuring a small play icon linking to the PyData TLV presentation (`https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo`).
*   **Box 2:** Displays 'Ahuzat Dibuk'. The aesthetic should subtly incorporate a heatmap gradient element. The text explains it as a Python scraping and data visualization project generating Tel-Aviv parking lot occupancy heatmaps for residents. 
    *   *UI Actions:* Links styled as "Media Outputs" pointing to the news features (`https://13tv.co.il/item/news/domestic/internal/parking-902956407/` and `https://www.mako.co.il/nexter-news/Article-ae43964b891bf71027.htm`), and a "Source Log" link to the original Facebook publication (`https://www.facebook.com/groups/secrettelaviv/posts/10159636301195943/`).
*   **Box 3:** Displays '2D Part Orienting'. The design should feature a faint, geometric polygon outline in the background. The text describes a C++ implementation in an open-source computational geometry library of a push plan algorithm to orient a given polygon.
    *   *UI Actions:* A link pointing to the library info and code (`https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/`).
*   **Box 4:** Displays 'The Turing Jest'. The card should have a playful, split-screen UI motif (representing the arena). The text outlines it as an LMSYS-like arena where LLMs compete at making and explaining puns, rated by users.
    *   *UI Actions:* A "Launch Arena" button linking to (`https://jest.geekip.dev`).
*   **Box 5:** Displays 'Rhymes of Israel'. The design includes a subtle Chrome extension puzzle-piece icon. The text describes it as an LLM-powered extension rewriting Israeli news headlines into comedic, highschool-yearbook-style rhymes.
    *   *UI Actions:* An "Install Extension" button linking to the Chrome Web Store (`https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eainginjgdkpgolpjniijdihfbeeeklb`).
*   **Box 6:** Displays the current Portfolio Website. The card features a recursive, "meta" design—perhaps a tiny image of the website itself or an infinity mirror icon. The text acknowledges the meta-nature of presenting the very site the user is navigating.
    *   *UI Actions:* A self-referential link pointing to (`https://geekip.dev`).
*   **Box 7 (The Output / Connections Terminal):** Distinct from the project boxes, this acts as the "Network Outbound" module. It is a sleek, vertical stack of social links designed to look like active API endpoints.
    *   *UI Actions:* Direct links to `github.com/gevak`, `linkedin.com/in/gevakip`, and `facebook.com/geva.kipper`, accompanied by minimal, modern icons.

**The Footer: The IDE Status Bar**
Anchoring the bottom of the page is a persistent status bar, styled exactly like the bottom bar of VS Code (a thin, solid bright blue or purple strip). 
*   On the far left, an icon and text read: `Compiled by: Claude [AI Model]`. 
*   On the far right, a live JavaScript-driven counter acts as the system stopwatch. It features a clock icon next to a monospace string formatted as `Uptime: [HH:MM:SS] ` which ticks every second, calculating the time dynamically elapsed since the exact static timestamp: `2026-02-22 01:30:12`.
