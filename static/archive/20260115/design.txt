### Design Concept: " The Generative Terminal"

**Visual Style & Atmosphere**
The website aims to mimic a high-end, futuristic command-line interface (CLI) that has been "beautified" by an evolving AI. The color palette should be deep charcoal (`#0d1117`) for the background, with text in a crisp, syntax-highlighted monospace font (like Fira Code or JetBrains Mono). Accents should act as "syntax highlighting"—soft neon cyan for commands, warm amber for warnings, and pastel purple for links. 

The entire page should feature a subtle "scanline" overlay and a slight glow effect (bloom) around the text to replicate the feeling of a high-resolution OLED monitor. The background should have a very faint, slow-moving matrix of binary or hex code representing the "AI's thought process" behind the current daily design.

**Header & Introduction: The Prompt**
At the very top, instead of a traditional nav bar, display a large, blinking cursor prompt:
`root@ai-architect:~$ explain user --id="Geva Kipper"`

Immediately below, the "response" generates in real-time (typewriter effect). It displays **Geva Kipper** in large, bold ASCII-style block letters or a variable weight font. Underneath, a single clean line reads: *"Software Engineer at Google."*

**The Dynamic Subtitle**
Below the bio, a boxed "System Notification" banner appears with a pulsing amber border. The text reads:
*"⚠ ARCHITECTURE WARNING: This interface is hallucinated daily. Current build seed generated by AI Model [Version X]. Layout volatility: High."*
This emphasizes the "ever-changing" narrative requested.

**The Main Interface: The Conversational Stream**
The six project sections should not be static grids. They should be arranged vertically as a "Chat History" between the user and the AI.

Imagine a center column layout. Between each project, there is a small, grayed-out query appearing on the left side (representing the User), such as `> User: Show me data visualization projects`, followed by the AI's response on the right side: the Project Card.

**Project Card Design (The 6 Boxes)**
Each project box looks like a "rich-media" return object in a JSON code block, but stylized for readability.

1.  **GlglStats:**
    *   **Visual:** The card features an animated audio visualizer bar (CSS animation) reacting to a silent beat.
    *   **Layout:** Split view. Left side contains the description of the LZ77 / Python compression algorithm. Right side features the video thumbnail for the PyData TLV talk.
    *   **Action:** A button styled as a `Play` command `[ ./run_glglstats.exe ]` links to the website.

2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk:**
    *   **Visual:** A background texture resembling a topographical heat map (red to green gradients).
    *   **Layout:** The text describes the Tel-Aviv parking scraper.
    *   **Action:** Three "citation" badges at the bottom link to the 13TV news, Mako article, and the original Facebook secret group post, styled as `[Reference Link 1]`, `[Reference Link 2]`, etc.

3.  **2D Part Orienting:**
    *   **Visual:** A minimalist geometric wireframe polygon rotating slowly in the corner of the card.
    *   **Layout:** Technical description of the C++ / Computational Geometry library implementation.
    *   **Action:** A `[View Source]` button linking to the project page.

4.  **The Turing Jest:**
    *   **Visual:** A graphic of two robot emoji icons facing off (`🤖 vs 🤖`).
    *   **Layout:** Description of the LLM punning arena.
    *   **Action:** A button labeled `[Enter Arena]` taking the user to the joke site.

5.  **Rhymes of Israel:**
    *   **Visual:** A newspaper icon turning into a music note.
    *   **Layout:** Explains the Chrome extension for comedic news rhyming.
    *   **Action:** A button labeled `[Install Extension]` with the Chrome Web Store icon.

6.  **The Recursive Portfolio (Meta):**
    *   **Visual:** A "droste effect" image (an image of a computer screen showing the website, showing the website...).
    *   **Layout:** "Recursion error detected: Self-referencing loop found."
    *   **Action:** A link to `geekip.dev` labeled `[ reload_universe() ]`.

**Contact Section: The Footer Array**
The output stream ends with an array object `const social_links = [...]`.
Three large, interactive blocks appear side-by-side:
*   **GitHub:** Icon glows white on hover.
*   **LinkedIn:** Icon glows blue on hover.
*   **Facebook:** Icon glows dark blue on hover.

**The Footer & Stopwatch**
At the very bottom of the page, separated by a horizontal rule, is the "System Status" footer.
*   **Credit:** Text aligned to the left: *"Site architecture generated by AI Model: Claude 3.5 Sonnet."*
*   **The Chronometer:** Aligned to the right, a digital monotype clock. It has a label: *"SYSTEM UPTIME (SINCE EPOCH 2026-01-15):"*
*   **Functionality:** Since the date is in the future, the clock acts as a "Time to Singularity" countdown or, if interpreted as a sci-fi setting where 2026 is the past, it counts upward. The format should be `HH:MM:SS` with milliseconds flickering rapidly to add kinetic energy to the page.
