The global aesthetic of the page combines deep space elegance with modern glassmorphism. The background is a sprawling, high-resolution SVG starry night sky (using #05050A as a base) with subtle, CSS-animated twinkling stars. The typography uses "Space Grotesk" for headers to provide a futuristic feel, and "Inter" for highly readable body text. Accent colors are lunar silver, neon astrolabe-gold, and glowing cyan.

On initial load, the user is presented with a full-screen hero section (100vh). In the center of the screen sits a large, interactive, 3D-rendered Moon. Surrounding the moon is an elliptical orbital track serving as the "Moon Calendar," marked with 28 glowing nodes representing the 28 days of February. Above the moon, elegant white typography introduces the developer: "Geva Kipper." Below the name is the sentence: "Software Engineer currently developing high-impact tech solutions at Google." Beneath that, rendered in a glowing monospace font simulating a system log, is the subtitle: "System Log: This website is re-designed each day by AI and is thus ever-changing." 

The user is prompted by a subtle pulsing animation to interact with the orbital track. Dragging a slider along the 28 nodes advances the days of February. With each node passed, the Moon visually alters its phase using CSS/JS masking, slowly waxing from a sliver. When the user reaches the 28th node (February 28), the Moon transitions to a dazzling "Supermoon" state. A dramatic CSS-driven burst of light (a volumetric lighting effect) shoots downward, dissolving the darkness below and revealing the previously hidden portfolio content section through a smooth, vertical scroll unlock.

The portfolio section is styled as a glowing lunar landscape viewed from above, where the projects exist as six sleek, frosted-glass "monoliths" (using CSS `backdrop-filter: blur()`). These project cards are arranged in an asymmetrical, masonry-style grid, each casting a long, dynamic shadow away from the central moonlight. 

**Box 1: GlglStats**
Designed with a background pattern of undulating soundwaves integrated with rigid, digital block-compression artifacts. The title features a neon cyan data-glitch hover effect. It features a brief description of the Python LZ77 compression pop-chart analysis, accompanied by two sleek pill-buttons: one linking to the live site at https://glglstats.geekip.dev, and another containing a YouTube play icon that opens the PyData TLV presentation link (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo).

**Box 2: Ahuzat Dibuk**
This card's background features a faded, CSS-drawn geographic grid overlaying a muted, thermal heatmap gradient (red-to-blue) that subtly shifts on hover. The text explains the Python scraping and Tel-Aviv parking occupancy visualization. Below the text is a "Media Coverage" cluster of minimalist icons linking to the Channel 13 (https://13tv.co.il/item/news/domestic/internal/parking-902956407/) and Mako (https://www.mako.co.il/nexter-news/Article-ae43964b891bf71027.htm) articles, alongside a classic Facebook icon directing to the Secret Tel-Aviv post (https://www.facebook.com/groups/secrettelaviv/posts/10159636301195943/).

**Box 3: 2D Part Orienting**
This aesthetic leans heavily into computational geometry. The card features animated wireframe polygons that slowly rotate and align against a faint bounding box based on cursor movement. The text describes the C++ implementation for the push plan orientation algorithm, accompanied by an open-source GitHub-style button linking to the TAU project page (https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/).

**Box 4: The Turing Jest**
A theatrical but futuristic design. The card features a subtle background watermark of two overlapping, minimalist robot heads structured like comedy/tragedy masks. The text details the LMSYS-style LLM pun competition arena. A vibrant, gamified "Enter Arena" button takes the user to https://jest.geekip.dev.

**Box 5: Rhymes of Israel**
Designed to mimic a digital piece of high-school lined notebook paper that transitions into a newsprint texture under a soft spotlight. The text outlines the LLM Chrome extension that transforms news headlines into comedic rhymes. At the bottom, a stylized "Add to Chrome" button links directly to the Chrome Web Store extension page (https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eainginjgdkpgolpjniijdihfbeeeklb).

**Box 6: The Meta Portfolio**
This card has an "infinite mirror" CSS trick or recursive wireframes of the site itself, highlighting the meta nature of the project. The text cheekily points out that this very website is one of the engineering feats on display. A self-referential hyperlink styled as an endless loop icon directs to https://geekip.dev.

**Section 7: The Social Hub**
Below the six main monoliths is a wide, dashboard-style glass panel representing a lunar rover's communication interface. It is minimal and symmetrical, displaying crisp, glowing vector icons for GitHub (github.com/gevak), LinkedIn (linkedin.com/in/gevakip), and Facebook (facebook.com/geva.kipper). Hovering over each icon triggers a radar-ping ripple animation.

At the very absolute bottom of the page, acting as the footer, is a sleek command-line interface tier. It features monospace green text reading: "Generated and architected by Claude AI." Next to it is a live, ticking JavaScript stopwatch with a digital aesthetic, explicitly displaying the Hours, Minutes, and Seconds that have elapsed exactly since "2026-02-28 01:19:00", tying the exact reveal date back to the concept of ongoing, forward-moving time.
