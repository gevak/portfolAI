### Portfolio Website Design: "TERMINAL.AI"

**Overall Aesthetic & Experience**

The website is a full-screen, immersive retro terminal experience. The viewport mimics a curved CRT monitor, with subtle scanlines, screen flicker, and a persistent, gentle phosphor glow. The entire design is contained on a single, scrollable page. The color palette is stark: a glowing phosphor green (#39FF14) and a secondary amber (#FFBE0B) for accents, all on a deep, near-black background (#0A0A0A). The primary font is a monospaced, pixelated typeface like 'VT323'. All animations are sharp, digital, and punctuated by subtle glitch effects.

**Initial Load Sequence**

Upon visiting the site, the screen is black. A green, blocky cursor `█` blinks in the top-left corner. A boot-up sequence types itself out line-by-line:
```
> INITIALIZING GEEKIP.DEV VINTAGE INTERFACE...
> LOADING MODULES... [OK]
> CHECKING CONNECTION... [SECURE]
> GENERATING DAILY UI FROM AI SEED: [A_RANDOM_ALPHANUMERIC_STRING]...
> RENDER COMPLETE.
```
After this sequence, the main content fades in with a soft, pixelated transition.

**Header Section**

At the top, the developer's name, "Geva Kipper," is displayed in large, glowing green text with a subtle, animated chromatic aberration effect, making the letters appear to slightly split into red, green, and blue channels.

Below the name, in a smaller, solid green font, is the single sentence: `> Software Engineer at Google, focusing on large-scale systems and applied AI.`

Underneath this, a subtitle in the amber accent color constantly glitches. The text "This website is re-designed each day by AI" flickers, with characters occasionally being replaced by random symbols or static blocks before correcting themselves, visually reinforcing the "ever-changing" concept.

**Content Grid: The "Modules"**

The seven boxes are arranged in a responsive grid. On a wide screen, they form a 3x2 grid for the projects, with the final "Contacts" box spanning the full width underneath. Each box is framed by ASCII-style borders (`┌─`, `│`, `└─`) that glow faintly. Hovering over a box causes its border to glow brighter and its content to exhibit a more pronounced glitch effect.

1.  **[ MODULE_01: GLGLSTATS ]**
    *   Text: A short description, `Python project measuring Israeli pop-song repetitiveness via LZ77 compression and visualizing the patterns.`
    *   Links: Displayed as command-line prompts.
        *   `>> LAUNCH_SITE [glglstats.geekip.dev]`
        *   `>> PLAY_PRESENTATION [PyData TLV]`
        *   The text for the links glows amber on hover.

2.  **[ MODULE_02: AHUZAT DIBUK ]**
    *   Text: `Python scraping & data-vis project analyzing Tel-Aviv parking occupancy to generate predictive heat-maps for residents.`
    *   Links:
        *   `>> VIEW_NEWS_REPORT [Channel 13]`
        *   `>> VIEW_NEWS_REPORT [Mako]`
        *   `>> READ_ORIGINAL_POST [Facebook]`

3.  **[ MODULE_03: 2D PART ORIENTING ]**
    *   Text: `C++ implementation of an efficient algorithm for constructing a 'push plan' to orient a polygon within a computational geometry library.`
    *   Link:
        *   `>> ACCESS_CODE_AND_INFO`

4.  **[ MODULE_04: THE TURING JEST ]**
    *   Text: `An LLM arena where AI models compete to generate and explain puns. User ratings determine the wittiest AI.`
    *   Link:
        *   `>> ENTER_THE_ARENA [jest.geekip.dev]`

5.  **[ MODULE_05: RHYMES OF ISRAEL ]**
    *   Text: `A Chrome extension using an LLM to rewrite Israeli news headlines into comedic, high-school yearbook-style rhymes.`
    *   Link:
        *   `>> INSTALL_EXTENSION [Chrome Web Store]`

6.  **[ MODULE_06: META_PORTFOLIO ]**
    *   Text: `>SYSTEM_LOG: PROJECT 'GEEKIP.DEV' - AN INFINITE LOOP OF SELF-REFERENCE. STATUS: STABLE. THIS IS IT.`
    *   Link:
        *   `>> REFRESH_INTERFACE [geekip.dev]`

7.  **[ MODULE_07: ESTABLISH_CONTACT ]**
    *   This box is styled as a direct command prompt.
    *   `> connect github -u gevak`
    *   `> connect linkedin -u gevakip`
    *   `> connect facebook -u geva.kipper`
    *   Each line is a separate link. Clicking one makes the line flash brightly before navigating.

**Footer Section**

A long, dashed horizontal line separates the content grid from the footer. The footer text is smaller and has less glow, as if it's system information.

On the left: `> UI designed and generated by a large language model.`

On the right, a real-time stopwatch with a label: `> TIME_ELAPSED_SINCE_GENESIS_v1.0:`
The clock displays the time passed since `2025-07-25 01:13:21` in an `HH:MM:SS` format, with the numbers ticking up dynamically, rendered in the same monospaced font.
