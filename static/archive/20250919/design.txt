### Portfolio Design: "The Hacker's Terminal"

**Overall Concept & User Experience**

The website is a single, full-screen interactive terminal. The initial view is a "locked" screen, immersing the user in a dark, hacker-themed environment. The entire experience is designed to feel like the user is decrypting or accessing a secure system, with the portfolio content being the "payload." The color palette is strictly limited to a dark charcoal/black background (#111111), a primary glowing text color like cyan or lime green (#00FFF7 or #39FF14), and a secondary white for readability. The font is a modern monospace, like 'Fira Code' or 'Hack'.

**Phase 1: The Initial Entry**

Upon loading, the screen is almost entirely black. A dynamic, multi-layered "Matrix"-style animation of falling text characters (a mix of ASCII, random numbers, and perhaps some Hebrew/C++ symbols relevant to the projects) rains down the screen. The effect is subtle in the background, not overwhelmingly busy.

In the center of the screen, a single line of text types itself out with a blinking cursor:

`> GEVA KIPPER // SOFTWARE ENGINEER @ GOOGLE`

After a brief pause, a second line types out below it:

`> System rebuilding... AI Daily Design protocol initiated. Session visuals are ephemeral.`

Finally, a call to action appears:

`> PRESS [ENTER] TO DECRYPT AND VIEW PORTFOLIO`

Pressing Enter or tapping the screen triggers the transition to Phase 2. The falling text effect intensifies for a moment, then gracefully fades into a much sparser and slower background animation, ensuring it doesn't distract from the content.

**Phase 2: The Decrypted Content Grid**

Once the user "enters," the header text remains at the top. The main content area, previously empty, now populates with a grid of seven boxes. This population is animated: each box appears sequentially with a "decryption" effect, where a block of scrambled characters quickly resolves into the final, readable content.

The layout is a responsive grid. On a desktop, it's a 3x2 grid for the six project boxes, with the seventh "links" box centered below them. On mobile, it becomes a single-column layout.

Each box is styled as a semi-transparent panel with a thin, glowing border in the primary text color. On hover, the box's glow intensifies, and a faint, subtle CRT scanline effect appears over it.

### **Content of the Boxes**

**Box 1: GlglStats**
*   **Title:** `// Project: GlglStats`
*   **Description:** A Python project measuring the repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs via LZ77 compression, with visualizations of repetition patterns.
*   **Links:** `[> Launch Application]`, `[> Watch PyData TLV Talk]`

**Box 2: Ahuzat Dibuk**
*   **Title:** `// Project: Ahuzat Dibuk`
*   **Description:** A Python data-scraping and visualization tool that generates heat-maps of parking lot occupancy in Tel-Aviv for resident use.
*   **Links:** `[> News Story (13tv)]`, `[> News Story (Mako)]`, `[> Original FB Post]`

**Box 3: 2D Part Orienting**
*   **Title:** `// Project: 2D Part Orienting`
*   **Description:** C++ implementation of a 'push plan' algorithm for orienting polygons, contributed to an open-source computational geometry library.
*   **Links:** `[> View Code & Paper]`

**Box 4: The Turing Jest**
*   **Title:** `// Project: The Turing Jest`
*   **Description:** An LLM-powered arena where AI models compete to generate and explain puns, with crowd-sourced user ratings.
*   **Links:** `[> Launch Application]`

**Box 5: Rhymes of Israel**
*   **Title:** `// Project: Rhymes of Israel`
*   **Description:** A Chrome extension leveraging an LLM to rewrite Israeli news headlines into comedic, highschool-yearbook-style rhymes.
*   **Links:** `[> Install Chrome Extension]`

**Box 6: The Portfolio Itself (Meta Project)**
*   **Title:** `// Project: geekip.dev (self_reference_detected)`
*   **Description:** A meta-project entry for this very portfolio site, built with modern JavaScript and a dynamically generated AI concept.
*   **Links:** `[> Re-initialize Interface]`

**Box 7: Contact & Social Links**
*   **Title:** `// Directory: /connect`
*   **Description:** `Accessing external network links...`
*   **Links:** `[> GitHub]`, `[> LinkedIn]`, `[> Facebook]`

All links (`[> Text]`) have a hover effect where the brackets `[ ]` glow brighter and the `>` symbol subtly animates, perhaps sliding slightly to the right.

**The Footer / System Bar**

At the very bottom of the page is a fixed footer styled like a terminal's status bar. It has a solid, slightly lighter background than the main page (e.g., #1A1A1A) and is separated by a thin glowing line.

*   **Left Side:** A credit line in the secondary white text color.
    `>> AI Design & Concept by [AI Model Name]`

*   **Right Side:** A live stopwatch, rendered in the primary glowing text color.
    `>> System Uptime: [0000h:00m:00s]`

This stopwatch dynamically counts up in hours, minutes, and seconds from the specified date and time: 2025-09-19 01:03:13. This adds a constant, live element to the page, reinforcing the "active system" theme.
