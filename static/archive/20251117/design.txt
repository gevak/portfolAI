The overall mood is a dark, elegant whiskey bar: deep charcoal background, warm amber and copper highlights, fine-grain “wood” texture on the main content panel, and subtle glass reflections on each project “shot.” The page is a single vertical scroll on mobile and a mostly above-the-fold layout with gentle scrolling on desktop. Typography: a refined serif (e.g. “Playfair Display” or similar) for headings / shot names, and a clean geometric sans (e.g. “Inter” / “Nunito”) for body text. Animations are slow and liquid-like: fades, slight tilts, and smooth easing.

At the very top, a full-width “bar counter” hero section. Center-left, large name: “Geva Kipper” in the serif, with a softly glowing amber underline. Underneath in one concise line: “Geva Kipper is a software engineer at Google, building data‑driven systems and playful side projects.” To the right or slightly overlapping below, a stylized “whiskey flight board” illustration: a wooden plank seen in perspective, with 7 semi-transparent shot glasses aligned horizontally. Each glass is faintly labeled 1–7, corresponding to the sections below, and subtly reacts on hover (a gentle glow and a slight “sloshing” animation of the liquid).

Directly under the name line, a subtitle in smaller sans-serif: “This portfolio is re‑designed each day by AI—its layout, colors, and tasting notes are ever‑changing.” Below it, a thin line of microcopy: “Come back tomorrow for a different flight.” Visually emphasize that the site changes daily: allow for variable accent colors (e.g. amber + teal one day, amber + magenta another), occasional font pair variations, and small layout shifts (e.g. cards arranged in a different order or alternating left/right layouts), all driven by an “AI daily remix” script. Include a small “Today’s Blend” badge that shows the current date and a few auto-generated adjectives (“smoky · experimental · playful”) picked randomly each day beneath the subtitle.

Scrolling down, the main body is a single column of 7 “shot cards” for desktop placed in a responsive grid: on large screens, they form a staggered two-column layout (shots 1, 3, 5, 7 left; 2, 4, 6 right), each card overlapping the wooden bar-texture panel slightly, like glasses placed on a counter. On mobile, they stack vertically. Each shot card looks like a glass coaster plus a stylized shot-glass silhouette: rounded rectangle with a faint glassmorphism effect (blurred background, subtle border, inner reflection) and an icon at the top: a minimalist whiskey glass filled with a different liquid color per project. The top label on each card: “Shot #X” in small caps, followed by the project’s name as the main headline.

**Shot #1 – GlglStats**  
Card color accent: bright copper / orange, evoking lively pop music. Title: “Shot #1: GlglStats.” Under it, a one-line “tasting note”: “A Python reduction of Israeli pop to pure compression ratios and repetition patterns.” Beneath, a short paragraph: “GlglStats measures the repetitiveness of Israeli pop‑chart songs using LZ77 compression and visualizes repetition patterns in famous tracks.” Two clear call-to-action buttons styled as “tasting tokens”:

- Primary button: “Visit GlglStats” → https://glglstats.geekip.dev  
- Secondary button: “Watch the PyData TLV talk” → https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo  

On hover, the card’s whiskey glass icon shows animated “soundwave” rings or bars. Optionally, include a small line showing “Notes: Python · LZ77 · Data viz” in pill-shaped tags under the description.

**Shot #2 – Ahuzat Dibuk**  
Card accent: dark reddish amber, slightly “urban night” feeling. Title: “Shot #2: Ahuzat Dibuk.” Tasting note: “A scraped and stirred look at Tel‑Aviv’s parking lots, served as heat‑maps for residents.” Short paragraph: “Python scraping and visualization of Tel‑Aviv car parking occupancy, generating heat‑maps to help residents find space in the city.” Below, a trio of neat link pills labeled:

- “Channel 13 News Story” → https://13tv.co.il/item/news/domestic/internal/parking-902956407/  
- “Mako Nexter Article” → https://www.mako.co.il/nexter-news/Article-ae43964b891bf71027.htm  
- “Original Secret Tel Aviv post” → https://www.facebook.com/groups/secrettelaviv/posts/10159636301195943/  

The glass icon for this card can have a tiny city skyline silhouette inside the liquid. Hover effect: a subtle “map” grid fades in the background of the card.

**Shot #3 – 2D Part Orienting**  
Accent: pale golden whiskey with a geometric pattern. Title: “Shot #3: 2D Part Orienting.” Tasting note: “A C++ geometry shot—precise, efficient, and definitely not on the rocks.” Description: “A C++ implementation in an open‑source computational geometry library, computing efficient push‑plans to orient a given polygon.” Underneath, a prominent text link / button: “Learn more & view code” → https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/  

Inside the card, show a tiny diagram-like illustration: a polygon being nudged along arrows. On hover, animate simple lines / arrows sliding slightly, as if the polygon is being “pushed” into place. Tag line: “Notes: C++ · Computational Geometry · Algorithms.”

**Shot #4 – The Turing Jest**  
Accent: more playful—amber mixed with electric purple / teal. Title: “Shot #4: The Turing Jest.” Tasting note: “An arena where language models compete to deliver the cleverest pun and explanation.” Description: “An LMSYS‑style arena: LLMs battle head‑to‑head at making and explaining puns, and users rate their answers.” Button: “Enter The Turing Jest” → https://jest.geekip.dev  

Visual: a shot glass wearing a tiny jester’s hat icon, or a small mask and smile motif. Hover effect: the card text wobbles very slightly (as if laughing), and the liquid in the icon glass ripples. Add tags: “Notes: LLMs · Humor · Crowdsourced ratings.”

**Shot #5 – Rhymes of Israel**  
Accent: brighter golden with a playful neon accent (maybe mint or coral) to suggest lighthearted mischief. Title: “Shot #5: Rhymes of Israel.” Tasting note: “A Chrome extension that turns Israeli news headlines into yearbook‑style rhymes.” Description: “This extension uses an LLM to rewrite Israeli news site headlines into comedic rhymes in the style of a high‑school yearbook.” Button: “Install Rhymes of Israel” → https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eainginjgdkpgolpjniijdihfbeeeklb  

Background motif: faint diagonal lines reminiscent of notebook paper. Hover effect: the project title line morphs into a short rhyming couplet that cycles through several AI‑generated examples (client can predefine a few sample rhymes).

**Shot #6 – Meta Portfolio (This Site)**  
Accent: slightly different—perhaps clear glass with subtle opalescent edge, to imply self-reference. Title: “Shot #6: The Ever‑Changing Portfolio.” Subtitle line: “Yes, this very bar you’re standing in.” Description: “A single‑page, AI‑reimagined portfolio that presents side projects as a whiskey‑tasting flight—redesigned each day by AI.” Button: “Visit geekip.dev (meta link)” → https://geekip.dev  

In this card, show the whiskey flight board graphic again, but miniaturized. Include a tiny line: “Today’s layout, colors, and tasting notes were generated by AI at build time.” Hover effect: the card reflects a thumbnail of the current page (like a hall-of-mirrors effect) with a subtle shimmer.

**Shot #7 – Social Flight**  
Accent: deep, almost-black whiskey with metallic gold rim, signaling a “digestif” / closing shot. Title: “Shot #7: Keep in Touch.” Tasting note: “Pair these links with your favorite beverage and a good idea.” Inside, three iconic social buttons, each styled as a minimalist, circular icon over a coaster:

- GitHub → github.com/gevak  
- LinkedIn → linkedin.com/in/gevakip  
- Facebook → facebook.com/geva.kipper  

Each icon has a slight inset glow on hover, with tooltips: “Code”, “Network”, “Life”. Arrange them horizontally on desktop, stacked on mobile. This is the final shot card, slightly larger, positioned just above the footer.

Below the shots, a slim, full-width footer bar in a darker charcoal, with a thin copper top border. On the left side, a small line of text in the sans-serif: “Daily redesigns and layout crafted by OpenAI’s ChatGPT (GPT‑4).” Underneath in smaller text: “Concept distilled automatically; content authored by Geva’s code and experiments.” On the right side, a digital “stopwatch” display showing time since 2025‑11‑17 01:07:09. The stopwatch uses a seven-segment or modern digital typeface; text like: “Aging time: HH:MM:SS since 2025‑11‑17 01:07:09.” It updates live every second with JavaScript, calculating the difference between the current timestamp and 2025‑11‑17 01:07:09, and smoothly rolling the numbers like a real timer. On hover, a small tooltip: “Like good whiskey, side projects improve with age.”

General interaction details:  
– Use gentle parallax on scroll in the hero’s background (e.g., the bar shelves and bottles shift slightly).  
– Each shot card fades up and slightly slides in as it enters the viewport, like a glass being placed on the bar.  
– Provide a small “Flight Overview” mini-nav pinned at the top once you scroll past the hero: compact row of numbered dots or mini shot icons labeled 1–7, clicking each smoothly scrolls to that card.  
– Responsiveness: On mobile, cards are full-width with slightly larger text; hero simplifies to stacked name → subtitle → small flight icon; the daily AI “Today’s Blend” badge moves under the subtitle.

Finally, every midnight (user’s local time or server-based), the “AI daily redesign” script can randomly alter: accent colors, order of the shots (while keeping numbering attached to project names), subtle background textures (different types of wood or bar ambiance), and the adjectives in “Today’s Blend,” reinforcing the idea that the portfolio is alive and re‑poured each day.
