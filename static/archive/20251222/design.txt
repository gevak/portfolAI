A single-page “Winter Solstice” experience: the page starts in near-black “polar night” at the top and gradually transitions into pale dawn and then crisp winter daylight toward the bottom. The scroll itself is the narrative—projects are arranged on a vertical “darkest-to-brightest timeline,” so the earliest/most experimental work lives in the deepest night and the most recent/most polished work sits in the brightest area. The background is a subtle animated gradient: deep indigo → midnight blue → slate → icy blue → winter white, with barely-there drifting “snow dust” particles (very low opacity, slow movement). A thin, glowing vertical axis line runs down the center like a meridian/solstice marker; it brightens as the user scrolls, creating the feeling of the sun returning.

At the top (in darkness), place a hero block with large typography: **Geva Kipper** in an elegant sans-serif with a faint aurora glow around the letters. Beneath, a single sentence: “Software engineer at Google, currently building and shipping production systems at scale.” Below that, a smaller subtitle in a lighter weight: “This portfolio is re-designed each day by AI—an ever-changing solstice.” Add a small “today’s variation” badge that looks like a frosted glass pill (no actual code described, just the visual). The hero also includes a minimal “scroll to sunrise” cue: a small crescent-to-sun icon that rotates slightly as the user begins scrolling.

The projects appear as **six main project boxes plus a final links box** (arranged as a timeline of seven “constellation cards”), each card alternating left/right of the central meridian line. Each card looks like a frosted glass panel with soft blur, hairline borders, and a “rim light” that intensifies further down the page. Each has: a title, a one-paragraph description, and a compact footer strip for links (with understated icons). Every card has a tiny “star map” header: a handful of dots connected by thin lines, unique per project (so each project feels like its own constellation). As the page transitions toward brightness, these constellation dots become less star-like and more “crystalline” (subtle evolution from night sky to ice facets).

1) **GlglStats** appears near the top in the darkest zone. The card uses a deep indigo tint with a faint waveform/LZ77 “compression ribbon” motif across its background (like layered stripes). Text: “GlglStats — Python project measuring repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression, with visualizations of repetition patterns across famous songs.” Link strip includes: **Site:** https://glglstats.geekip.dev and **PyData TLV talk video:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo. The video link is styled as a “lantern” button: a small warm glow that contrasts the cold palette, hinting at storytelling in the dark.

2) **Ahuzat Dibuk** sits slightly lower where the night begins to lighten to navy. The card’s motif is a faint city grid overlaid with a heat-map glow that pulses softly. Description: “Ahuzat Dibuk — Python scraping + data visualization project collecting Tel-Aviv parking lot occupancy and generating resident-friendly heat-maps.” Link strip includes three press/publication links: https://13tv.co.il/item/news/domestic/internal/parking-902956407/ , https://www.mako.co.il/nexter-news/Article-ae43964b891bf71027.htm , and the original Facebook publication: https://www.facebook.com/groups/secrettelaviv/posts/10159636301195943/ . The “heat” areas of the motif are subtle and constrained, keeping the design elegant.

3) **2D Part Orienting** appears around the “blue hour” zone. The card background shows faint geometric outlines: polygons, arrows, and a “push plan” path rendered like chalk on slate. Description: “2D Part Orienting — C++ contribution to an open-source computational geometry library, implementing an efficient algorithm for constructing a ‘push plan’ to orient a given polygon.” Link: https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/ . The card edges are sharper here, reflecting precision and geometry as the world becomes clearer with more light.

4) **The Turing Jest** sits at early dawn where the gradient turns steel-to-ice blue. The card motif is a split-mask theater face (comedy) abstracted into minimal lines, plus tiny speech bubbles that look like snowflakes. Description: “The Turing Jest — an LMSYS-like arena where LLMs compete at making and explaining puns, rated by users.” Link: https://jest.geekip.dev . This card is the first where the rim light is noticeably brighter, signifying the “return of humor” with the sun.

5) **Rhymes of Israel** is in a brighter morning zone with crisp white-blue tones. The card motif resembles a browser tab silhouette and headline strips, with rhyming end-words highlighted like glittering frost. Description: “Rhymes of Israel — a Chrome extension using an LLM to rewrite Israeli news headlines into comedic rhymes in the style of a highschool yearbook.” Link: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eainginjgdkpgolpjniijdihfbeeeklb . The link button here looks like a “snow-gloss” capsule—cleaner and more daylight-readable than earlier cards.

6) **Portfolio Website (meta)** sits near the brightest portion, close to winter noon. The card is intentionally minimal and reflective—almost mirror-like frosted glass—with a subtle recursion motif: nested rounded rectangles fading inward, implying “a site about the site.” Description: “Portfolio Website — a living single-page experiment (how meta) that keeps evolving.” Self-reference link: https://geekip.dev . The card feels like the culmination of the timeline: clearest, brightest, simplest.

7) **Links / Contact** is the final card at the brightest white with a faint warm sun tint at the very bottom edge. Present it as a clean “winter postcard” with three large, elegant link rows and small icons: GitHub: github.com/gevak , LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/gevakip , Facebook: facebook.com/geva.kipper . The central timeline line ends here in a small “sunrise pin” marker, as if the meridian reached its solstice turning point.

The footer is calm and minimal on a near-white background with a thin top border like a sheet of ice. It includes two elements aligned left/right: on the left, a credit line: “Designed by an AI model (ChatGPT) on 2025-12-22.” On the right, a live-looking stopwatch display labeled “Time since 2025-12-22 01:14:05” showing hours:minutes:seconds in a monospaced font, as if it’s a scientific instrument measuring the lengthening daylight. The overall feel stays elegant—ample spacing, restrained animations, high contrast for readability—while the solstice concept makes the page unmistakably unique and narrative-driven.
