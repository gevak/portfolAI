### **Portfolio Design: "The Adventurer's Path"**

**Overall Concept:**
The website is a single, vertically scrolling page that functions as a map from a top-down RPG. The visitor scrolls down to follow a character avatar along a winding path. Each major stop on the path is a project ("quest"). The visual style is minimalistic and elegant, using vector art with a dark-mode theme, accented by glowing elements that highlight interactive areas. The entire scene has a subtle, slow-drifting parallax effect to create a sense of depth and life.

**Header Section (The Starting Point):**
The page loads with a view of a tranquil, starlit clearing in a minimalist forest or on a floating island. In the center stands a small, stylized character avatar representing Geva. Above this scene, the main title appears in a clean, slightly stylized font reminiscent of a classic RPG title screen:

**Geva Kipper**
*Software Engineer at Google, building the next generation of developer tools.*

Just below, a smaller, glowing text element flickers subtly, as if it's a dynamic status update:
*This world is procedurally regenerated daily by AI. Its design is ever-changing.*

An animated "scroll down" icon, perhaps a glowing arrow or a gently pulsing orb, invites the user to begin the journey.

**The Journey & The Quests:**
As the user scrolls, the camera follows the avatar as it walks along a softly glowing path. The path meanders through different biomes or areas on the map, each themed to match the project it represents. When a project section comes into the viewport, the avatar stops, and a "Quest Log" panel elegantly fades in from the side. This panel is a semi-transparent dark rectangle with clean white text and glowing highlights for links.

**1. Quest: The Echoes of Pop (GlglStats)**
The path leads to an area resembling an ethereal soundstage or an observatory filled with floating musical notes and waveform patterns. The Quest Log appears:

*   **Quest Acquired:** The Echoes of Pop
*   **Description:** A Python project measuring the repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression. It visualizes the repetition patterns within famous songs to reveal their underlying structure.
*   **Objectives:**
    *   `[Link Icon]` **Explore the Data:** `https://glglstats.onrender.com/`
    *   `[Video Icon]` **Watch the Sage's Lecture (PyData TLV):** `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo`

**2. Quest: The Parking Prophecy (Ahuzat Dibuk)**
The path continues into a stylized, miniature city grid viewed from above. Certain areas of the grid glow with a heatmap effect, from cool blue to warm red. The Quest Log updates:

*   **Quest Acquired:** The Parking Prophecy
*   **Description:** A Python scraping project that collects and visualizes statistics on Tel-Aviv's car parking occupancy. It generates real-time heatmaps to guide residents to available spots.
*   **Objectives:**
    *   `[News Icon]` **Read the Town Herald (13tv):** `[Link]`
    *   `[News Icon]` **Consult the Mako Scrolls:** `[Link]`
    *   `[Community Icon]` **View the Public Decree (Facebook):** `[Link]`

**3. Quest: The Orienting Polygon (2D Part Orienting)**
The environment shifts to a geometric, crystalline landscape. The path winds past floating, slowly rotating polygons and abstract geometric patterns. The Quest Log updates:

*   **Quest Acquired:** The Orienting Polygon
*   **Description:** A C++ implementation of an efficient algorithm that constructs a 'push plan' to orient any given polygon. Contributed to a leading open-source computational geometry library.
*   **Objectives:**
    *   `[Code Icon]` **Study the Blueprints:** `https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/`

**4. Quest: The World Weaver's Map (This Portfolio)**
The path leads to a strange, recursive landmarkâ€”a glowing portal that reflects a miniature, swirling version of the website itself. The Quest Log updates with a meta-quest:

*   **Quest Acquired:** The World Weaver's Map
*   **Description:** A perpetual quest to explore the very world you inhabit. This single-page portfolio, designed as a top-down RPG, is a project in its own right.
*   **Objectives:**
    *   `[Recycle Icon]` **Gaze into the Aether:** `https://portfolio-dor1.onrender.com/`

**5. Final Section: The Guild Hall (Social & Contact)**
The path culminates at a central, starlit plaza. There are no more Quest Logs. Instead, three glowing pedestals stand in the center of the plaza. Hovering over each pedestal causes a sigil to brighten and the platform's name to appear. Clicking the pedestal opens the link in a new tab.

*   **Pedestal 1:** A GitHub Octocat sigil.
*   **Pedestal 2:** A LinkedIn 'in' sigil.
*   **Pedestal 3:** A Facebook 'f' sigil.

**Footer (The End Credits):**
At the very bottom of the page, as the map fades into darkness, two lines of simple, clean text appear, centered on the screen.

*This world was procedurally generated by Claude, an AI model from Anthropic.*
*Time since last world reset: [A live stopwatch counting up from 2025-06-14 01:05:35 in HH:MM:SS format]*
