### Portfolio Design: The Celestial Atlas of Geva Kipper

**Overall Concept:**
The website is a single-page, vertically scrolling journey through a procedurally generated star map. The background is a deep, dark space, filled with subtly twinkling stars, faint nebulae, and drifting cosmic dust. The color palette is dominated by dark blues, purples, and blacks, with vibrant, glowing accent colors for interactive elements and the "planets." The entire visual experience is smooth and cinematic, with parallax effects giving a sense of depth as the user scrolls.

**Initial View (The 'Big Bang'):**
Upon loading, the user is presented with a full-screen view of the cosmos. In the center, in a clean, elegant, and slightly glowing sans-serif font, is the name:

**Geva Kipper**
Currently building the future of AI anwsering at Google.

Directly below this, a smaller, more ethereal font announces the site's unique premise:
*This celestial map is procedurally re-drawn by AI each day, offering an ever-changing digital universe.*

A subtle, pulsating arrow or a slow-moving comet at the bottom of the screen invites the user to scroll down and begin their exploration.

**The Journey & Project Planets:**
As the user scrolls, the camera smoothly pans and zooms through the star map, following a faint, glowing orbital path that connects the different "planets" (projects). Each project is a unique celestial body, and as it comes into the center of the viewport, it glows brighter, and its corresponding information card materializes beside it. The card is a semi-transparent, dark-glass panel that blurs the starfield behind it, with crisp white text.

**1. Planet 'GlglStats': The Harmonic Sphere**
*   **Visual:** A slowly rotating planet made of glowing, intersecting soundwaves, resembling a ball of yarn woven from light. Faint, colorful pulses emanate from its core in time with a silent, abstract rhythm, visualizing the music analysis. The planet's dominant color is a vibrant magenta.
*   **Info Card:**
    *   **GlglStats**
    *   A Python project measuring the repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression, with visualizations of song patterns.

**2. Planet 'Ahuzat Dibuk': The Datapoint Grid**
*   **Visual:** A dark terrestrial planet overlaid with a glowing, orange-and-red grid. Patches of the grid pulse with intense heat, mimicking the parking occupancy heatmaps. Faint data streams can be seen flowing across its surface.
*   **Info Card:**
    *   **Ahuzat Dibuk**
    *   Python scraping and data visualization of Tel-Aviv parking lot occupancy, generating heat-maps to help residents find parking.

**3. Planet 'CGL-Prime': The Crystalline Structure**
*   **Visual:** Not a sphere, but a complex, rotating crystalline structure made of sharp, geometric polygons. Light refracts through its facets as it turns. One of its faces glows brighter than the others, representing the polygon being oriented. The color scheme is a cool, geometric cyan.
*   **Info Card:**
    *   **2D Part Orienting**
    *   A C++ implementation of an efficient algorithm to construct a 'push plan' for orienting any given polygon, contributed to an open-source computational geometry library.

**4. Planet 'Turing Jest': The Binary Worlds**
*   **Visual:** Two small, binary planets locked in a gravitational dance. One has the texture of a complex circuit board (the LLM), while the other is a chaotic jester pattern (the puns). They orbit each other, exchanging tiny sparks of light.
*   **Info Card:**
    *   **The Turing Jest**
    *   An LLM arena where AI models compete to generate and explain puns, with user-based ratings to determine the wittiest machine.

**5. Planet 'Rhymes of Israel': The Newsprint Orb**
*   **Visual:** A planet that appears to be made of scrolling, overlapping newspaper headlines. As headlines scroll by, they are "rewritten" on the fly into rhyming couplets that glow in a playful, bright yellow before fading.
*   **Info Card:**
    *   **Rhymes of Israel**
    *   A Chrome extension using an LLM to transform Israeli news headlines into comedic, high-school-yearbook-style rhymes.

**6. Object 'Portfolio': The Orrery**
*   **Visual:** A meta object. This isn't a planet, but a beautiful, glowing, golden orrery (a mechanical model of a solar system). At its center is a sun, and orbiting it are miniature, simplified versions of the five planets just seen. The orrery itself is this website.
*   **Info Card:**
    *   **The Celestial Atlas**
    *   This portfolio. A single-page, cosmic-themed website designed by AI, where my projects are represented as planets in an ever-changing universe.

**Final Section: The Communications Array**
*   **Visual:** After the last project, the user arrives at a sleek, futuristic space station or satellite array. Three distinct antennas point out into the void, each pulsing with a soft, white light. Hovering over an antenna makes it glow brighter and reveal its destination icon.
*   **Info Card:**
    *   **Contact & Code**
    *   Three large, iconic logos for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook are displayed side-by-side. Clicking a logo takes the user to the corresponding link. The hover effect makes the logo glow and subtly lift off the card.

**Footer (The Edge of the Universe):**
At the very bottom of the scroll, the starfield fades slightly to black, and two lines of text appear in a simple, monospace font.
