**Design Concept: The Defrosted Terminal**

**Visual Concept & The "Frost" Overlay**
Upon loading, the viewport is entirely obscured by a realistic, generative "winter frost" texture. This involves a canvas layer mimicking opaque, crystallized ice on a windowpane. The ambiance is cold, featuring whites, pale cyans, and silver tones. Centered on this frosted layer—appearing as if etched physically into the ice with a finger—is the header text: **"Geva Kipper"** in a bold, sans-serif font, followed by the sub-header: *"Software Engineer at Google."* Below this, much smaller and resembling a stamped manufacturing label, is the disclaimer: *"This interface is re-designed daily by AI. Current variation: [Current Date]."*

**Interaction Mechanics**
The user's cursor (desktop) or touch point (mobile) functions as a heat source. As the user moves their mouse, the frost layer dissolves in real-time following the path of the cursor, revealing the colorful, high-contrast content layer underneath. The edges of the "wiped" areas should have a soft, wet alpha gradient, simulating melting ice rather than a sharp cutout. Droplets of water (CSS animations) occasionally trickle down the revealing gaps. The goal is to encourage the user to "clean" the screen to view the portfolio.

**The Revealed Layout (Under the Ice)**
Once the frost is wiped away, the background is a deep, sleek "Midnight Blue" (almost black), providing a stark contrast to the white overlay. The layout utilizes a masonry or bento-grid system to arrange the seven content modules. The cards themselves feature a "Glassmorphism" effect—semitransparent dark glass with blurred backdrops and thin, glowing borders—making them look like advanced HUD elements preserved within the ice.

**Content Modules (The Grid)**

*   **Box 1: GlglStats**
    *   **Visual:** A background visualization of an audio waveform transforming into a data distinct bar chart.
    *   **Content:** Title "GlglStats" followed by the description of the Python/LZ77 algorithm.
    *   **Actions:** Two distinct pill-shaped buttons. One labeled "Visit Site" (linking to glglstats.geekip.dev) and a secondary button with a YouTube play icon labeled "PyData Talk" (opening the video in a modal).

*   **Box 2: Ahuzat Dibuk**
    *   **Visual:** A stylized, localized map of Tel Aviv with a heat-map overlay (shifting red to green).
    *   **Content:** Title and description regarding the scraping and parking logic.
    *   **Actions:** A recognizable "News Coverage" icon group containing links to Channel 13 and Mako. A separate "Community" link directs to the original Facebook Secret Tel Aviv post.

*   **Box 3: 2D Part Orienting**
    *   **Visual:** An animated SVG of a polygon rotating to fit a specific orientation (referencing the push plan). Blueprint styling.
    *   **Content:** Description of the C++ computational geometry project.
    *   **Actions:** A "View on TAU/CGL" button linking to the project page.

*   **Box 4: The Turing Jest**
    *   **Visual:** A split icon or graphic: half robotic circuit diagram, half jester hat.
    *   **Content:** Description of the LMSYS-like pun arena.
    *   **Actions:** A bold "Enter Arena" button linking to jest.geekip.dev.

*   **Box 5: Rhymes of Israel**
    *   **Visual:** A newspaper headline graphic that morphs/glitches into a comic book font.
    *   **Content:** Description of the LLM Chrome extension.
    *   **Actions:** A "Get Extension" button with the Chrome Web Store logo.

*   **Box 6: The Meta Portfolio**
    *   **Visual:** An "Infinity Mirror" effect using a screenshot of the site itself, recursively getting smaller.
    *   **Content:** Description highlighting that this is the site the user is currently viewing.
    *   **Actions:** A circular refresh button linking to geekip.dev (reloading the page/frost effect).

*   **Box 7: Connectivity (Socials)**
    *   **Visual:** Minimalist aesthetic, centered.
    *   **Actions:** Three large, evenly spaced icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Upon hover, these icons should glow with their respective brand colors (Purple for GitHub, Blue for LinkedIn/FB) to "warm up" the cold theme.

**The Footer & The Chronometer**
At the very bottom, anchored to the viewport (revealed only when the bottom ice is cleared), is a terminal-style text bar.

*   **Credit:** "Site architecture generated by [AI Model Name]."
*   **The Temporal Anomaly:** A monospace digital clock display.
*   **Logic:** It calculates the time passed *since* **2026-01-30 01:23:50**.
*   **Display:** Because the current date is likely prior to 2026, the timer should display a negative value (e.g., *T-Minus 14,050 hours...*) or, to fit the "AI from the future" narrative, it should count upwards in bright red, implying the site has traveled back in time. The format should be `DD:HH:MM:SS`.
