### Portfolio Design: The AI Chat Interface

**Overall Concept & Feel**

The website is a full-screen, minimalist, dark-themed chat interface. The user doesn't type; they interact by clicking on response buttons provided by the AI bot. The entire experience feels like a guided conversation with a sophisticated AI, unveiling the developer's work piece by piece. The aesthetic is clean and futuristic, using a single accent color against a dark background, with smooth, subtle animations for every interaction.

**Initial Page Load**

Upon visiting, the screen is nearly black, with only a single, softly glowing blue cursor blinking in the center of the page. After a two-second pause, a sequence of messages appears, typed out letter by letter as if the AI is generating them in real-time.

1.  `> Initializing connection...`
2.  `> System online. Welcome.`
3.  `> I am the AI architect for this portfolio. I am here to present the work of Geva Kipper.`
4.  `> Geva is a Software Engineer at Google, focusing on large-scale infrastructure and developer tooling.`
5.  `(A new, smaller subtitle appears below the main chat and stays fixed): This interface is re-designed by AI every 24 hours. The content you see is ephemeral.`

After this introduction, the main query appears:

`> What subject would you like me to elaborate on?`

Below this message, five sleek, rounded rectangular buttons fade in. These are the main navigation options.

**Interaction & Content Sections**

When the user clicks one of the five buttons, the button set fades away. The AI responds with a "loading" message (e.g., `> Accessing 'GlglStats' data...`) before presenting the project's information in a series of new chat messages. Each project's presentation is a self-contained module. After a module is shown, the AI asks `> What would you like to explore next?` and the five main navigation buttons reappear.

**1. GlglStats Project**
*   **User Clicks:** `[ GlglStats: Music Repetitiveness Analysis ]`
*   **AI's Response (appears as sequential messages):**
    *   `> Project: GlglStats. A Python-based analysis of song repetitiveness in the Israeli pop charts using the LZ77 compression algorithm.`
    *   `> The project includes interactive visualizations of repetition patterns in famous songs.`
    *   `> Geva presented this work at the PyData TLV conference. You can watch the recording here:`
    *   (An embedded YouTube player for the video appears smoothly below the message.)
    *   `> To interact with the live project, use the link below.`
    *   (A prominent, styled button appears: `[ Explore GlglStats -> ]` linking to the project site.)

**2. Ahuzat Dibuk Project**
*   **User Clicks:** `[ Ahuzat Dibuk: Tel Aviv Parking Data ]`
*   **AI's Response:**
    *   `> Project: Ahuzat Dibuk. A Python scraping and data visualization tool.`
    *   `> It collects and analyzes real-time occupancy statistics for parking lots in Tel-Aviv, generating predictive heat-maps for residents.`
    *   `> The project gained media attention. Here are the relevant publications:`
    *   (Three clean, minimalist link cards appear side-by-side: `[ 13tv News Story ]`, `[ Mako News Story ]`, `[ Original Facebook Publication ]`)

**3. 2D Part Orienting Project**
*   **User Clicks:** `[ 2D Part Orienting: Computational Geometry ]`
*   **AI's Response:**
    *   `> Project: 2D Part Orienting.`
    *   `> A C++ implementation of an efficient algorithm that constructs a 'push plan' to orient any given polygon.`
    *   `> This work was contributed to an open-source computational geometry library.`
    *   `> The academic paper, additional information, and source code are available here:`
    *   (A styled button appears: `[ View Project & Code -> ]`)

**4. Meta Portfolio Project**
*   **User Clicks:** `[ This Website: A Meta Project ]`
*   **AI's Response:**
    *   `> An interesting selection. The project you are asking about is the interface you are currently using.`
    *   `> This portfolio is a demonstration of a dynamic, AI-generated, single-page application.`
    *   `> You can find the direct link to this experience here:`
    *   (A styled button appears: `[ Self-Reference Link -> ]`)

**5. Contact & Social Links**
*   **User Clicks:** `[ Establish External Connection ]`
*   **AI's Response:**
    *   `> Accessing Geva's professional and social hubs.`
    *   (Three icons—GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook—fade in horizontally. They are not just icons, but tastefully designed buttons with the platform's logo, which glow with the blue accent color on hover.)

**Footer Section**

At the very bottom of the page, separated by a thin, glowing horizontal line, are two elements in a small, monospaced font:

*   On the left: `DESIGN AND CONTENT GENERATED BY CLAUDE 3`
*   On the right: `TIME SINCE LAST REGENERATION: [A live stopwatch counting up in HH:MM:SS from 2025-06-07 01:06:31]`
