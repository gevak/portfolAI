**Visual Concept & Atmosphere**
The visual theme is "The Void of Data." The background should be a deep, infinite abyss—a radial gradient fading from midnight blue to pitch black. Floating within this 3D space are the UI elements, rendered as translucent, frosted-glass distinct "shards" or cards (Glassmorphism style). There is no scrollbar; the browser window is a closed physics container. The aesthetic balances high-tech minimalism with playful chaos. All text should use a clean, futuristic sans-serif typeface (e.g., Inter or Roboto Mono) in varying weights.

**Physics & Interaction**
*   **Zero-Gravity State:** All elements (the header, the project cards, the social links) float freely in the window, drifting slowly with Brownian motion and gently rotating. They should possess simulated mass and bounce off the viewport edges and each other with soft, damped collisions.
*   **The Repulsor Cursor:** The user’s mouse cursor is replaced (or highlighted) by a glowing, semi-transparent sphere. This cursor acts as update physics force. Moving the cursor quickly through the cloud of elements creates a "shockwave," pushing the project cards away and causing them to spin, simulating a zero-gravity collision.
*   **Magnetic Hover:** When the user slows the cursor and hovers directly over a specific card, the physics simulation for that specific element pauses. The card gently uprights itself, scales up slightly, and increases in opacity to ensure readability and clickability.

**Header Elements**
Positioned loosely in the center (initially), but free to drift:
*   **Primary Identity:** A large, pill-shaped glass container holding the text "Geva Kipper" in bold white, with a secondary line in a lighter grey: "Software Engineer at Google."
*   **The AI Badge:** A smaller, contrasting badge (perhaps with a blinking neon border) attached to the header that reads: *"This site is re-designed daily by AI. Current iteration: [Dynamic Date]. Status: Ever-changing."*

**The Project Shards (Content Sections)**
The six project sections are individual floating cards. Each card contains a thumbnail visual, a title, a brief description, and the required links. The links should be styled as pill-buttons that glow on hover.

1.  **GlglStats:** Visualized with a waveform graphic. Includes the description of the repetitive pop-chart analysis using LZ77. Contains two buttons: "Visit Site" and "Watch PyData Talk" (opens a modal or lightbox for the YouTube video).
2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk:** Visualized with a stylized heat map of Tel-Aviv. Describes the parking lot scraping and visualization. Includes text links to the "Channel 13 Item," "Mako Article," and "Facebook Post."
3.  **2D Part Orienting:** Visualized with a geometric polygon animation. Describes the C++ push-plan algorithm. Includes a "View Project & Code" button.
4.  **The Turing Jest:** Visualized with a split robot/human icon. Describes the LLM punning leaderboard. Includes a "Play the Game" button.
5.  **Rhymes of Israel:** Visualized with a retro newspaper texture or quill icon. Describes the Chrome extension for AI news rhymes. Includes an "Install Extension" button.
6.  **Meta-Portfolio:** Visualized with a recursive "picture-in-picture" wireframe icon. Text: "The site you are currently navigating." Includes a "Recursion Link" pointing back to geekip.dev.

**Social Satellite**
The social links are not a list, but individual circular icons (GitHub, LinkedIn, Facebook) that are physically tethered to each other by thin, visible lines, floating together as a "molecule" or satellite cluster. They drift independently from the project cards but stay grouped together.

**The Footer & Stopwatch**
Anchored non-intrusively at the bottom center (or floating heavily at the bottom like sediment):
*   A monospaced, digital LED-style counter.
*   **Format:** `Created by AI Model [Model Name]. Runtime: HH:MM:SS`
*   **Logic:** The timer calculates the difference between the current time and the timestamp `2026-01-04 01:19:45`. If the current date is before this timestamp, it counts down (negative time); if after, it counts up.
*   **Detail:** The numbers should tick realistically. If a collision sends a heavy project card crashing into the footer, the footer should sway slightly before settling back into place.
