### The Ever-Changing Codex: A Website Design

**Overall Concept & Initial View**

The website loads not to a page, but to a beautifully rendered, closed, dark leather-bound book floating in a dark, subtly animated space with faint, glowing digital particles. The book cover is embossed with the name "Geva Kipper" in a classic serif font. As the user scrolls or clicks, the book opens with a smooth, 3D page-turning animation, revealing the content within. The site is a single, continuous scroll, designed to look like an infinitely long, open book. A fixed, textured "spine" runs down the center of the viewport, separating the left and right pages. The background of the pages is a high-quality, off-white digital parchment.

The header is spread across the top of the first two pages. On the left page, the name **Geva Kipper** is prominently displayed. Below it, a single sentence: "Software Engineer at Google, working on the future of search." On the right page, the subtitle appears: "This portfolio is a living document, re-designed by AI each day." This subtitle text has a subtle, shimmering, or "glitching" effect, and its accent color or font-weight subtly changes on each visit, visually reinforcing its ever-changing nature.

**Core Interaction: Code into Visuals**

As the user scrolls down, each project is a new "spread" in the book. The left page is the "source code," and the right page is the "magic." When a new project scrolls into view, a snippet of relevant code animates onto the left page as if being typed by an invisible hand. Simultaneously, on the right page, an interactive visual representation of that project materializes, animated as if being constructed directly from the code. The primary accent color for all animations and interactive elements is a vibrant, electric gold, standing out against the parchment and dark text.

**Project Sections / "Chapters"**

1.  **GlglStats:** On the left page, a snippet of Python code featuring the LZ77 algorithm appears. As it types out, glowing golden particles representing data points flow from the code, across the spine, and onto the right page. They coalesce into a small, animated waveform graph that visualizes a song's repetition pattern. Below this visual, the project title appears, followed by the description. Links to the site and the conference video are presented as elegant, underlined text that glows gold on hover. The video link opens in a clean, borderless lightbox overlay.

2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk:** A Python code snippet with terms like `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` is typed onto the left page. On the right, a stylized, minimalist map of Tel Aviv fades in. Then, animated heat-map colors (from cool blue to warm red) wash over the map, originating from the spine, to represent parking occupancy. The title, description, and links to the news stories and Facebook post appear below.

3.  **2D Part Orienting:** A C++ code snippet with `CGAL` and geometric function names appears on the left. On the right, a wireframe polygon materializes. A series of faint, animated lines then "push" against its edges, causing the polygon to elegantly rotate and shift into a final, stable orientation. Title, info, and the code link are displayed beneath this animation.

4.  **The Turing Jest:** A code snippet showing an LLM prompt or API call appears on the left. On the right, a minimalist chat bubble interface animates. A question appears, and then a punny answer is typed out letter-by-letter, followed by a witty explanation. The title, description, and a button-like link to the site fade in below.

5.  **Rhymes of Israel:** A JavaScript snippet for the Chrome extension is typed on the left. On the right, a generic, black-text news headline appears. An animation then "rewrites" it, with letters shifting, swapping, and changing color to gold until it becomes a comedic, rhyming headline. The title, description, and a link to the Chrome Web Store appear beside an elegant Chrome icon.

6.  **The Meta Portfolio:** A snippet of JavaScript, perhaps `document.addEventListener('scroll', ...)`, is written on the left. On the right, a miniature, simplified wireframe sketch of the very website the user is viewing draws itself. A tiny golden dot on the wireframe moves down as the user scrolls, mirroring their own position on the page. The title, description, and self-referencing link appear, completing the meta-narrative.

**Final Spread & Footer**

The final section is the last spread of the book. The left page is sparsely populated with closing `</body>` and `</html>` tags. On the right page, three icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook are presented not as corporate logos, but as elegant, custom-drawn emblems resembling wax seals. Hovering over them causes the seal to glow brightly and reveal the name of the platform.

Below the book, as if on the "table" it rests upon, is the footer. This area has a dark, textured background, distinct from the book itself. On the left, it reads: "This site was designed and described by a generative AI model." On the right, a live stopwatch is prominently displayed, continuously counting up in Hours:Minutes:Seconds from the designated start time of 2025-08-04 01:20:37, adding a final, dynamic element to the page.
