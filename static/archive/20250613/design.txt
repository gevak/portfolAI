### Portfolio Design: "The AI's Daily Draft"

**Overall Concept:**

The website is a single-page vertical journey down a "stream of consciousness" or a digital nerve fiber. The user's scroll action actively draws and reveals this journey. The aesthetic is clean, dark-themed, and futuristic, blending minimalism with subtle, dynamic graphical elements that reinforce the "AI-generated" theme. The core visual is a central, glowing, gently meandering line that serves as the timeline, with projects branching off it like nodes of data.

**Initial View (Above the Fold):**

The user lands on a nearly black screen (#0D0D0D). In the center, the name **Geva Kipper** materializes with a soft, slow-fading glow effect. Below it, in a smaller, crisp white font, appears the sentence: "Developing the future of search at Google."

After a two-second delay, the subtitle types itself out underneath, with a blinking cursor effect: **"This site is an ever-changing artifact, re-designed daily by a generative AI."**

At the very bottom center of the screen, a small, pulsating chevron icon (⌄) subtly encourages the user to scroll down.

**The Interactive Timeline:**

As the user begins to scroll, the main visual element comes to life. A thin, cyan-colored, glowing line begins to draw itself down the exact center of the page. This line is not perfectly straight; it has slight, organic, smooth curves, as if tracing a path. As the user scrolls, the line extends further down the page. The projects are "milestones" that appear along this central line.

**Section 1: GlglStats**

*   **Activation:** As the user scrolls, the central cyan line develops a small, pulsing circular node on its path. From this node, a thin horizontal line shoots out to the right, connecting to the project's content box.
*   **Content Box:** This is not a sharp-edged box. It's a borderless, semi-transparent panel with a frosted glass effect (`backdrop-filter: blur(10px)`). The text and elements within appear to float over the dark background.
*   **Layout:**
    *   **Title:** `GlglStats` in a bold, capitalized, slightly larger font.
    *   **Description:** The Python project description in a clean, sans-serif font.
    *   **Links:** Below the description are two interactive buttons. They are pill-shaped, outlined in the same cyan as the timeline. On hover, the outline fills with a solid cyan and the text turns black.
        *   Button 1: `View Project →` (links to glglstats.onrender.com)
        *   Button 2: `Watch Presentation ▷` (links to the YouTube video)

**Section 2: Ahuzat Dibuk**

*   **Activation:** Further down the scroll, a new node pulses into existence on the central line. This time, the connecting horizontal line shoots out to the left, creating a balanced, zig-zag layout.
*   **Content Box:** Same frosted glass panel as Section 1.
*   **Layout:**
    *   **Title:** `Ahuzat Dibuk`
    *   **Description:** The Python scraping project description.
    *   **Links:** Three pill-shaped outline buttons, stacked vertically.
        *   Button 1: `News: Channel 13 →`
        *   Button 2: `News: Mako →`
        *   Button 3: `Original Post →`

**Section 3: 2D Part Orienting**

*   **Activation:** The timeline continues downward, and another node appears, with its connector line branching back to the right.
*   **Content Box:** Frosted glass panel.
*   **Layout:**
    *   **Title:** `2D Part Orienting`
    *   **Description:** The C++ computational geometry project description.
    *   **Link:** A single, prominent button.
        *   Button: `Explore The Algorithm & Code →`

**Section 4: The Portfolio Itself (Meta)**

*   **Activation:** The timeline branches to the left.
*   **Content Box:** Frosted glass panel.
*   **Layout:**
    *   **Title:** `Project: Sentient Portfolio`
    *   **Description:** "A self-referential project demonstrating modern front-end design and the theme of this very site. This artifact is a testament to the journey it showcases."
    *   **Link:**
        *   Button: `View Source Loop →` (This is the self-referencing link)

**Section 5: Social & Contact Links**

*   **Activation:** The timeline reaches its end. The central cyan line terminates in a final, slightly larger, slowly pulsating node at the center of the screen. No content box appears. Instead, three icons fade in an arc around this final node.
*   **Icons:** The icons for **GitHub**, **LinkedIn**, and **Facebook** are rendered as clean, minimalist, white SVGs. On hover, they glow brightly with the same cyan color as the timeline and scale up by 10%. Clicking them opens the respective profiles in a new tab.

---

**Footer:**

At the very bottom of the page, below the final node and icons, sits the footer content in a small, unobtrusive, dimmer white font.

*   **Line 1:** `Design autonomously generated by OpenAI's GPT-4 model.`
*   **Line 2:** A live stopwatch is displayed underneath, showing the time elapsed since the "genesis" of the project. It uses a monospaced font to prevent the layout from shifting as the numbers change.
    *   `Genesis Uptime: <HOURS>h <MINUTES>m <SECONDS>s`
    *   The time starts counting up from 2025-06-13 01:09:17.
