### Website Design: The Digital Onion

**Overall Concept & User Experience**

The website is a single, continuous page that embodies the theme of "peeling back layers." The user experience is one of discovery and depth. The initial view is minimalist and abstract, and as the user scrolls, layers of the background visually "peel" away, revealing the content underneath in a fluid, animated sequence. The aesthetic is elegant and digital, using clean lines and subtle animations rather than literal a onion graphic. It feels less like a static page and more like an interactive digital object.

**Initial View (The Outer Layer)**

Upon loading, the screen is filled with a dark, deep eggplant-purple background. In the center, a set of fine, glowing, off-white concentric rings subtly pulse and rotate, like a stylized cross-section of an onion or a loading state. These rings are not perfect circles, but slightly organic, geometric polygons.

Overlaid on this animation in the center of the screen, the text appears in a crisp, elegant serif font:

**Geva Kipper**

Below this, a subtitle appears in a slightly dimmer, italicized font:
*This website is redesigned each day by AI, its form ever-changing. A subtle "scroll to peel" prompt with a downward-pointing chevron fades in and out at the bottom of the viewport.*

**Scrolling Interaction & The "Peeling" Effect**

As the user begins to scroll, the central text and rotating rings smoothly fade and shrink away. The primary interaction is the background itself. Itâ€™s composed of multiple semi-transparent layers. The deepest layer is the solid eggplant-purple. Above it are 2-3 layers of a lighter, textured, beige-colored overlay, reminiscent of onion skin.

As you scroll down, these beige layers don't just move up; they appear to peel away from the corners of the screen with a subtle, curling CSS animation. The active content area is always in the "cleared" central part of the screen, framed by the remnants of the peeling layers at the edges. This creates a powerful sense of depth and continuous revelation with every scroll.

**Content Sections / Boxes**

The seven content sections are not contained in harsh boxes. They are distinct content areas that flow vertically, appearing one after another as the user scrolls. Each section is aligned either to the left or right in an alternating pattern, creating a pleasant visual rhythm down the page. When a section is in the center of the viewport, it is at its sharpest and brightest, while sections scrolled past or yet to come are slightly dimmed.

3.  **2D Part Orienting (Left-aligned):**
    *   **Title:** 2D Part Orienting
    *   **Description:** C++ implementation of an efficient algorithm for constructing a 'push plan' to orient polygons, contributed to an open-source geometry library.
    *   **Links:** A single "Code & Details" button with a code bracket icon (`</>`), leading to the TAU project page.

4.  **The Turing Jest (Right-aligned):**
    *   **Title:** The Turing Jest
    *   **Description:** An LLM arena where models compete at generating and explaining puns, with user-based rating.
    *   **Links:** A "Visit The Arena" button with a comedy/tragedy masks icon, linking to `jest.geekip.dev`.

5.  **Rhymes of Israel (Left-aligned):**

6.  **This Website (Right-aligned):**
    *   **Title:** The Onion Portfolio
    *   **Description:** A meta-project; this very website, designed around a theme of peeling back layers to reveal content.
    *   **Links:** A single "View Source" or "Self-Reference" button with a circular arrow icon, linking to `geekip.dev`.

7.  **Contact (Centered):**
    *   As a final layer, this section appears centered. It contains no title, just three large, minimalist icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook, arranged horizontally. On hover, the icons glow, and the name of the platform appears subtly below.

**Footer**

At the very bottom of the page, once all content is scrolled past, the "peeling" effect concludes, leaving the clean, dark eggplant-purple background. A thin, horizontal line separates the content from the footer. The footer text is small, in the same off-white sans-serif font.
