### The Contribution Landscape: A Procedurally Generated Portfolio

**Overall Concept & User Experience**

The website is a single, continuous, interactive 3D space. The background and foundation of the entire page is a vast, dark, three-dimensional grid that visualizes Geva Kipper's GitHub contribution history. Each square on the grid represents a day, and its height is determined by the number of commits made on that day, creating a "cityscape" of productivity. This landscape is the navigation space. The user experience is not one of scrolling down a page, but of flying through this 3D commit history, with the camera smoothly moving from one project highlight to the next.

**Initial View**

Upon loading, the page opens to a wide-angle shot of the glowing green contribution cityscape, with subtle stars or particles drifting in the dark background. The camera performs a slow, cinematic pan across the terrain. Over this visual, the primary text elegantly fades into view in the center of the screen:

**Geva Kipper**
*Software Engineer at Google, building intelligent systems for a more creative world.*

Directly beneath this, in a slightly smaller, more ethereal font, the key premise is stated:

*This portfolio is procedurally regenerated by an AI every 24 hours based on my latest contributions. The design you see is unique to today.*

**Navigation and Interaction**

As the user begins to scroll, the camera gracefully swoops down into the 3D landscape and flies towards the first project location. Each of the six project sections is a distinct "island" or "platform" floating just above a significant cluster of high-commit bars in the cityscape. When the camera focuses on a project, the corresponding platform becomes the focal point, while the rest of the contribution landscape fades slightly into the background. The user can also freely pan and zoom around the entire 3D space with their mouse, hovering over individual commit bars to see a tooltip with the date and commit count.

**Project Section Design**

Each of the six project sections is presented on a semi-transparent, glass-like panel that hovers in the 3D space. The text and icons on the panel have a soft, white glow. The design for each section is consistent:

*   **Title:** A bold, modern, sans-serif heading (e.g., **GlglStats**).
*   **Description:** A concise, one-to-two sentence description of the project and its technology.
*   **Links:** Below the description, a clean row of interactive links. Instead of plain text, these are small, glowing icons with text labels appearing on hover: a chain-link for websites, a play button for the YouTube video, a newspaper for news articles, a code symbol (`</>`) for the C++ project page, a puzzle piece for the Chrome extension, and a person icon for social links. When a user clicks a link, it glows brightly before opening in a new tab.

1.  **GlglStats Island:** Hovers over a dense area of commits. The glass panel features the project description and two links: one icon for the project site and one for the PyData conference video.
2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk Island:** Positioned over another flurry of activity. The panel presents the description alongside three link icons: two for the news stories and one for the original Facebook post.
3.  **2D Part Orienting Platform:** Located near an older, foundational part of the commit history. The panel displays the C++ project description and a single link icon for the code and academic information.
4.  **The Turing Jest Island:** Found above a recent, intense block of commits. The panel presents the LLM arena description with a prominent link icon to the live site.
5.  **Rhymes of Israel Platform:** This panel hovers over a sharp, recent spike in commits. It contains the description and a single link icon to the Chrome Web Store installation page.
6.  **Meta Portfolio Island:** This final project panel is positioned over the most recent commit activity, representing the work on the portfolio itself. It simply states: "A self-referential portfolio experiment, designed by an AI to visualize its own creation history." It has a single link icon pointing to its own domain (geekip.dev).

**Footer and Final Section**

After the user scrolls past the sixth project, the camera pulls back slightly to a wider view of the cityscape. Here, the final section appears. It's another floating glass panel containing three prominent, glowing icons for **GitHub**, **LinkedIn**, and **Facebook**, linking to the respective profiles.

At the very bottom of the view, anchored to the screen regardless of camera position, is a minimalist footer. Itâ€™s rendered in a clean, monospace font:
