A single-page “Conveyor-Belt Factory” portfolio where the entire layout feels like a clean, modern industrial floor: brushed metal panels, soft shadows, subtle grain, and calm accent colors (cool teal + warm amber) used like safety paint. The page scroll is framed as a continuous factory line: projects are “items” traveling on a horizontal conveyor that runs across the screen, while the user scrolls vertically to move the camera along the line (parallax), revealing different stations. The conveyor belt itself is a thin, animated strip with repeating tread texture moving slowly left-to-right; project “crates” (the six project boxes plus the links box) sit on top of it, each with a small label plate and a stamped ID. Micro-interactions are factory-themed but elegant: hover effects resemble inspection lights passing over a crate; clicking “opens” a crate with a smooth lift-panel animation into a details drawer.

At the very top is a clean hero header like a factory nameplate bolted to a wall. It reads “Geva Kipper” in a bold, modern sans (large, centered). Under it, a single sentence about current work at Google (one line only) presented as a “shift status” readout on a slim LED-style strip. Immediately below: a subtitle in a smaller font, styled like a maintenance note: “This website is re-designed each day by AI — ever-changing by design.” The hero area also includes an understated “Factory Control Panel” strip with tiny indicators (e.g., “Line Speed,” “QC,” “Build”) purely decorative, reinforcing the theme without clutter. A “Start the Line” button scrolls the viewport to the first station, as if starting the belt.

The central content is one continuous conveyor line with clearly marked pipeline stages shown as overhead signage spanning the width of the page. Stages could be: “Intake,” “Assembly,” “Testing,” “Packaging,” “Shipping,” “Showroom.” Each project crate appears at a different stage, implying it has progressed through the pipeline. As the user scrolls, stage signage glides overhead and the belt continues moving; the crates remain readable and stable (no motion sickness), while background elements (pipes, subtle machinery silhouettes, moving hazard stripes) parallax gently. Each crate/section has a consistent layout: title plate, a short description, a “spec sheet” area with tech tags (Python/C++/Chrome Extension/LLMs), and action buttons styled as physical buttons (rounded, embossed) for links. A small vertical “QC checklist” on the right side of each crate can show 3–5 bullet items (e.g., “Data,” “Viz,” “Perf,” “UX”) with checkmarks as a design motif.

Crates/sections (in order along the line) should be:
1) **GlglStats** — a Python crate at the “Testing” station with a faint waveform or compression-like pattern etched on it. Description states it measures repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression and visualizes repetition patterns in famous songs. Two prominent buttons: “Visit glglstats.geekip.dev” and “Watch PyData TLV talk” linking to the YouTube video. The expanded drawer (on click) can show a larger visual motif: a stylized repetition heat strip or compression blocks.
2) **Ahuzat Dibuk** — a Python scraping + data viz crate under “Assembly/Monitoring,” with a map-grid emboss. Description: collects statistics on Tel-Aviv car parking occupancy and generates heat-maps for residents. Provide three clear link buttons: one to each news story (13tv, mako) and one to the original Facebook publication. The drawer could show a mini heat-map-like gradient swatch as ornamentation.
3) **2D Part Orienting** — a heavier “machined” crate near “Precision/Robotics,” with line-art of a polygon and arrows suggesting push plans. Description: C++ implementation in an open-source computational geometry library for an efficient algorithm constructing a push plan to orient a polygon. One button: “Project page & code” linking to the TAU CGL URL.
4) **The Turing Jest** — a playful crate at the “Showroom” station, still industrial but with a subtle comedy twist: a stamped “PUN QA PASSED” seal. Description: LMSYS-like arena where LLMs compete at making/explaining puns, rated by users. Button: “Open jest.geekip.dev.”
5) **Rhymes of Israel** — a crate at “Packaging,” decorated with a tongue-in-cheek “Yearbook Edition” sticker. Description: Chrome extension using an LLM to rewrite Israeli news headlines into comedic rhymes in a high school yearbook style. Button: “Install from Chrome Web Store” linking to the provided store URL.
6) **Portfolio Website (Meta)** — a crate placed at the very end of the conveyor, labeled as the “Factory Itself,” with a mirror-like panel. Description: a portfolio website project (how meta). Button: “geekip.dev” (self-reference). This crate can have a special animation: when opened, it reveals a miniature schematic of the same conveyor layout, reinforcing the meta concept.

After these, the **last box/section** is a “Dispatch Dock” crate containing the social links presented as three stamped metal tags with icons and clean typography:  
- github.com/gevak  
- linkedin.com/in/gevakip  
- facebook.com/geva.kipper  
This section feels like shipping labels: aligned, tidy, and highly scannable, with hover states that resemble a barcode scanner beam passing over each tag.

Throughout the page, typography stays modern and readable (one primary sans + a subtle monospace for “spec sheets” and timers). The color palette remains restrained; accents appear as safety highlights on buttons, labels, and stage signage. Animations are minimal and smooth: belt tread looping, occasional indicator blinks, and a gentle “steam” or dust motes effect in the background at very low opacity. Accessibility: strong contrast for text on panels, generous spacing, and motion reduced when the user prefers reduced motion (but still maintaining the factory aesthetic with static textures).

At the bottom, a slim “Factory Footer Plate” contains: (1) a credit line reading that the site was created by the AI model (you) in a small, tasteful monospace line, and (2) a prominently displayed stopwatch module labeled “Uptime Since 2025-12-20 01:06:15” showing hours:minutes:seconds ticking live. The stopwatch should look like a digital industrial counter—simple, crisp, and centered—set into the metal plate, with a subtle glow so it feels like an always-on control-room display.
