Here is a design description for the portfolio website:

**Overall Concept & Page Layout**

The website is a single, vertically scrolling page with a dark, sophisticated "developer terminal" aesthetic. The entire page emulates a `git log` timeline. A persistent, thin, glowing cyan vertical line runs down the left-hand side of the viewport, acting as the main spine of the commit history. As the user scrolls, this line appears to draw itself into view. Each project and section of the site is presented as a "commit" block attached to this timeline. The background is a very dark charcoal color with a subtle, low-opacity grid pattern, evoking a modern code editor. The primary font for headings and special text is a clean monospaced font (like Fira Code), while body text is a highly readable sans-serif (like Inter) for clarity.

**Header Section: The Initial Commit**

The page begins not with a traditional navigation bar, but with the "latest commit." This section is aligned with the top of the vertical timeline. It starts with a short, fake commit hash in a bright cyan color (e.g., `a1b2c3d`), followed by `(HEAD -> main)`. Below this, in a smaller, off-white monospaced font, is the author and date:
`Author: Geva Kipper <contact@geekip.dev>`
`Date: [Current Date]`

The main "commit message" is Geva's name in a large, bold font: **Geva Kipper**. Directly underneath is his professional one-liner: "Software Engineer at Google, working on the future of AI." Below this, a distinct subtitle is presented, perhaps with a small, animated "AI/robot" icon next to it, explaining: "This site's layout and design are regenerated by AI daily. What you see today may be different tomorrow."

**Project "Commits"**

Following the header, the six project sections appear sequentially as the user scrolls down. Each project is a self-contained content block, or "commit," visually connected to the main vertical timeline by a dot. Each block has a consistent structure:

1.  **Commit Header:** A unique 7-character commit hash (e.g., `f4d3e2a`) and a descriptive commit message using conventional syntax, like `feat(python): GlglStats - LZ77 analysis of pop music`.
2.  **Description:** A concise paragraph explaining the project as provided.
3.  **Links:** Below the description, links are presented not as simple-underlined text but as styled "pills" or "tags". Each pill has an icon and text. For example: A website link will have a 'link' icon and the site URL, a video link will use a 'YouTube' icon, a news story will have a 'newspaper' icon, and a code repository will have a 'GitHub' icon. These pills have a subtle hover effect, like glowing brighter or slightly lifting off the page.

The projects are presented in this "commit" format. The sixth project, the portfolio itself, has a meta commit message like `refactor(meta): Redesign portfolio with a git log theme`, with its link pill pointing to `geekip.dev`.

**Final Section: Social Links & Footer**

The last "commit" block before the footer is for social links. Its commit message would be `docs: Add contact and social links`. This block contains three larger, more prominent link pills for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook, each with its respective logo and a clear text label.

At the very bottom of the page, detached from the git log timeline, sits a minimalist footer. On the left, a small, discreet line of text reads: `Design by [AI Model Name]`. On the right, a live stopwatch is rendered in a crisp, monospaced font, displaying the time elapsed since `2025-09-21 01:08:46` in an `HH:MM:SS` format. This counter continuously updates, adding a dynamic and slightly eccentric touch to the page's conclusion.
