**Design Concept: The Sentient Terminal**

**Global Aesthetic & Atmosphere**
The visual theme is "BIOS Post-Human." The interface should resemble a high-resolution, futuristic command-line interface (CLI) or a system boot screen that has gained consciousness. The color palette is strictly high-contrast monochrome: deep void black (`#050505`) for the background and "Phosphor Green" or "Electric Amber" for the text and borders.

The entire page should sit within a container that adds a subtle "CRT monitor" curvature effect to the corners, complete with faint scanlines and a slight chromatic aberration (RGB split) on the text edges to simulate a raw digital signal. The font must be a crisp, tabular monospace typeface (e.g., JetBrains Mono or Fira Code). Instead of standard scrollbars, use a "progress bar" on the right edge indicating the user's position in the system memory.

**The "Boot" Sequence (Loading State)**
Upon loading, the site must not simply appear. It must "boot." Use a rapid sequence of text logs flashing on the screen for 1.5 seconds: *“Memory check... OK,” “Loading Personality Core... OK,” “Accessing Google Archives... OK,” “Generating Daily Layout [Seed: AI-Generated]... DONE.”* The screen then clears to reveal the main content, simulating a fresh system start-up.

**Header Section: The Identity**
Top-left justification. Geva Kipper's name appears large, utilizing a "glitch" effect on hover (characters rapidly cycling through potential letters before settling on the correct name).
*   **Role:** The sentence "Software Engineer working at Google" should appear below the name, styled like a system status report (e.g., `Current Process: Google`).
*   **The AI Meta-Tag:** Below the role, the subtitle regarding the AI redesign should look like a system warning or a comment block: `// NOTICE: This interface is re-compiled daily by AI. Entropy detected.` This text should pulse slowly.

**The Grid: Memory Allocation Blocks**
The six project sections and the social section should be arranged in a "Bento Box" grid layout—a responsive masonry grid where items look like allocated memory blocks or windows in a tiling window manager. Each box is outlined by a thin, 1px border.
*   **Hover State:** When the user hovers over a box, the background switches from black to the accent color (green/amber), and the text turns black (inverted video), imitating a terminal cursor selection.

**Content Modules (The Boxes)**

*   **Box 1 (GlglStats):**
    *   *Design:* The background features a subtle, animated CSS visualizer (vertical bars moving to a fake beat). The title "GlglStats" is bold.
    *   *Content:* Display the compression description and the link to the site. The YouTube link should be styled as a button labeled `[ EXECUTE_VIDEO_EVIDENCE ]`.

*   **Box 2 (Ahuzat Dibuk):**
    *   *Design:* The background should feature a faint, abstract grid map resembling a city block.
    *   *Content:* The project description focuses on "Data Extraction." The three links (News 1, News 2, Facebook) should be listed as a file directory tree structure (e.g., `├── Source: Channel 13`, `├── Source: Mako`, `└── Source: Facebook`).

*   **Box 3 (2D Part Orienting):**
    *   *Design:* Include a slowly rotating SVG wireframe polygon in the corner of this box to visualize the geometry.
    *   *Content:* Description of the C++ algorithm. The project link is styled as `[ ACCESS_SOURCE_CODE ]`.

*   **Box 4 (The Turing Jest):**
    *   *Design:* The design here separates into two halves using a dashed line, representing the "Arena" nature.
    *   *Content:* Description of the LLM pun competition. The link to `jest.geekip.dev` should be a blinking prompt: `user@arena:~/enter_jest $`.

*   **Box 5 (Rhymes of Israel):**
    *   *Design:* Use a font contrast here—the headline in a serif "newspaper" font, but the rhymes in the site's monospaced font, visually representing the rewriting process.
    *   *Content:* Description of the extension. The Chrome Store link should look like a download progress bar that is already at 100%.

*   **Box 6 (The Meta-Portfolio):**
    *   *Design:* This box should contain an "Infinite Mirror" effect. A small iframe or screenshot of the current website is visible inside the box, which contains a smaller version of the site, ad infinitum.
    *   *Content:* "A recursive pointer to this current instance." Link to `geekip.dev`.

*   **Box 7 (Connectivity):**
    *   *Design:* A wide, horizontal bar at the bottom of the grid.
    *   *Content:* The links for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook should not be standard icons. Instead, use ASCII part-characters to draw the logos, or simply use large, bracketed text labels: `[ GITHUB ]`, `[ LINKEDIN ]`, `[ FACEBOOK ]`.

**Footer: The Temporal Anchor**
Fixed to the bottom of the viewport is a status bar.
*   **Left Side:** Text reading: `Site Architecture: AI-Model-v1.0 // Auth: Geva Kipper`.
*   **Right Side:** A precise digital chronometer.
*   **The Stopwatch Logic:** The usage of a future date (2026) suggests a temporal anomaly or a "Time Until" countdown. However, the requirement is "time passed since." The timer should display the delta calculation. If the current date is before 2026, display the time as a negative count (e.g., `T-MINUS 14,020 hours`) in red text, implying a countdown to the "System Reboot." If the date is past 2026, it counts up in green. The seconds must tick visibly and frantically, emphasizing the passage of time.
