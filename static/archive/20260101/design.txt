Design the page as a sleek “escape room dossier” on a dark, elegant background: matte charcoal with subtle noise, thin gold/cyan accent lines, and soft spotlight gradients that feel like a desk lamp over evidence. The entire site is one single scrollable room, but it behaves like a puzzle board: faint blueprint grid, scattered “clues” (micro-typography, stamps, cipher wheels), and a calm ambient motion (very slow parallax on background schematics). The header is the “lock panel” at the top: **Geva Kipper** in a refined monospace + modern sans pairing, with one crisp sentence below: “Software engineer at Google, building systems that turn complex data into reliable products.” Under that, a smaller subtitle set in italic/condensed type: “This portfolio is re-designed each day by AI—an ever-changing escape room.” Include a prominent but minimal instruction line: “Solve the six puzzles to reveal résumé + contact.”

Make the core layout a centered grid of **six large puzzle boxes** (2 columns on desktop, 1 column on mobile), each styled like a premium escape-room prop: a glassy card with beveled edges, a small corner rivet, and a tiny “LOCKED” tag. Each box has a unique micro-puzzle interaction that unlocks its content. While locked, each card shows only: a title, a cryptic hint, and a small interactive element (dial, slider, draggable strip, match-to-pattern). When solved, the card “clicks” open with a subtle mechanical animation: the tag flips to “UNSEALED,” the full project description slides in, and the links appear as “evidence tabs.” The six boxes are:  
1) **GlglStats** — locked by a “compression strip” puzzle: a short lyric-like string where the user compresses by dragging repeated segments together until a progress bar hits the correct ratio. Once opened, show the project summary: Python project measuring repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using **LZ77** compression and visualizing repetition patterns in famous songs. Provide two prominent evidence tabs: **Site:** https://glglstats.geekip.dev and **PyData TLV talk (video):** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo (embed the video inline once unlocked, framed like a monitor on the desk).  
2) **Ahuzat Dibuk** — locked by a “heat-map alignment” puzzle: a small blurred map overlay that the user drags/rotates to align hotspots with faint city blocks. Once opened, show: Python scraping + data visualization project collecting Tel-Aviv parking occupancy and generating resident-friendly heatmaps. Present three evidence tabs styled like clipped newspaper headlines: https://13tv.co.il/item/news/domestic/internal/parking-902956407/ , https://www.mako.co.il/nexter-news/Article-ae43964b891bf71027.htm , plus “Original publication” as a stamped social clipping: https://www.facebook.com/groups/secrettelaviv/posts/10159636301195943/  
3) **2D Part Orienting** — locked by a “polygon push-plan” puzzle: a small polygon silhouette where the user chooses the correct push direction sequence by clicking arrows; wrong moves reset with a gentle shake. Once opened, show: C++ implementation in an open-source computational geometry library of an efficient algorithm constructing a push plan to orient a polygon. Add a single clean evidence button: https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/  
4) **The Turing Jest** — locked by a “pun lock” puzzle: a two-line riddle where the user must pick the better pun explanation between two options; correct choice unlocks. Once opened, show: LMSYS-like arena where LLMs compete at making and explaining puns, rated by users. Add the evidence link as a glowing “ARENA DOOR” button: https://jest.geekip.dev  
5) **Rhymes of Israel** — locked by a “headline rhyme meter” puzzle: a headline appears with missing rhyming end-words; the user cycles through options until the rhyme meter hits “perfect.” Once opened, show: Chrome extension that uses an LLM to rewrite Israeli news headlines into comedic rhymes in the style of a highschool yearbook. Add the install evidence button: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eainginjgdkpgolpjniijdihfbeeeklb  
6) **geekip.dev (Meta Portfolio Room)** — locked by a “mirror clue” puzzle: the card is slightly reflective/blurred until the user drags a flashlight beam across it to reveal the URL etched underneath. Once opened, show it as “Portfolio website project (how meta!)” with a self-reference evidence link: https://geekip.dev

After the six are solved, the page reveals a final “exit panel” section that slides up from beneath the grid: a clean résumé/contact reveal with a satisfying “vault opens” animation and a subtle confetti of tiny ASCII glyphs (kept tasteful and minimal). Place the **social links box** as the last panel in this reveal (styled like three metallic keycards), containing: github.com/gevak , linkedin.com/in/gevakip , facebook.com/geva.kipper . The overall tone should stay elegant: restrained motion, high-contrast typography, and premium UI polish—no cartoon padlocks—more like a modern museum exhibit of puzzles.

In the footer, include a thin divider line and two elements side-by-side: on the left, a small credit line in subdued text: “Generated by an AI model (design draft).” On the right, a “Stopwatch since breach” module that continuously counts **hours:minutes:seconds since 2026-01-01 01:18:57**, presented in a seven-segment style but with modern smoothing (thin rounded segments, soft glow). The stopwatch should feel like the escape-room timer, anchoring the theme while staying refined.
