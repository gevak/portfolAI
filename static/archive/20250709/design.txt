### **Portfolio Design: "The Algorithmic Atelier"**

**Overall Concept:**

The website is a single-page, full-screen, interactive 3D environment. The aesthetic is a minimalist, abstract digital art gallery or a floating "mind palace" in a void. The "room" has no hard walls but is defined by a floor plane and ambient, generative background visuals. The user navigates not by walking, but by orbiting a central point with a simple mouse drag, creating a smooth, cinematic experience. The entire scene is rendered with soft, dynamic lighting and subtle particle effects.

**Initial View & Header:**

Upon loading, the user is presented with the 3D scene. Floating elegantly in the center of the view, rendered as stylized 3D text, is the name:

**Geva Kipper**
*Currently building the future of AI at Google.*

Directly beneath this, in a smaller, slightly ethereal font that has a subtle "glitch" or "rendering" animation effect, is the subtitle:

*This portfolio's design is procedurally generated by AI each day. What you see is unique to today.*

The daily AI redesign is visually manifested through the scene's color palette. Each day, a new, harmonious tri-color scheme is generated, affecting the ambient background, the floor's reflective hue, and the accent lighting.

**The Portfolio Items (3D Objects):**

Seven distinct, low-polygon 3D objects float in a wide orbit within the space. These are the portfolio items. Hovering over an object causes it to glow softly and its title to appear in clean, sans-serif text. Clicking an object initiates a smooth camera zoom, making the object the focus of the screen while blurring the background. A minimalist, semi-transparent black modal window fades in beside the object, displaying its detailed information and links. Closing the modal returns the camera to the main orbital view.

1.  **GlglStats:** Represented by a slowly rotating, iridescent MÃ¶bius strip made of stylized musical notes. Upon click, the modal displays the project description, a link to the site "[Live Demo]", and a link to the video "[PyData Talk]".

2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk:** A stylized, translucent 3D block model of a city grid. Certain blocks pulse with a warm, heatmap-like glow, from yellow to red. The modal shows the description and provides three links: "[Channel 13 News]", "[Mako News]", and "[Original Facebook Post]".

3.  **2D Part Orienting:** A complex, crystalline polyhedron that is perpetually and slowly animating, its faces shifting and reconfiguring. The modal contains the description and a single link: "[Paper & Code]".

4.  **The Turing Jest:** Two classic comedy/tragedy masks facing each other, rendered in a chrome and circuit board texture. They slowly orbit one another. The modal presents the project description and a link: "[Try The Arena]".

5.  **Rhymes of Israel:** A 3D model of a rolled-up newspaper that, upon hover, unfurls slightly to reveal scrolling, headline-style text. The modal provides the project description and a call-to-action link: "[Install Chrome Extension]".

6.  **The Portfolio (Meta Project):** A beautiful, recursive object: a miniature, glowing wireframe model of the entire 3D portfolio scene itself, contained within a glass sphere. Clicking this opens a modal with a short, meta-description of the portfolio project and a self-referencing link: "[View The Source Of This Site]".

7.  **Contact & Socials:** This is represented by a simple, elegant, polished stone plinth. Floating just above it are the three universally recognized logos for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook, slowly rotating. Clicking this object opens a modal with three clean, direct links to the respective profiles.

**Footer:**

Fixed to the bottom of the viewport is a thin, unobtrusive, semi-transparent bar that stays in place regardless of 3D navigation. On the left, it reads:

*Designed by a custom-instructed generative AI model.*

On the right is a live stopwatch, continuously counting up from a fixed point in time, formatted as H:M:S.

*Time since last manual update: [Live updating timer from 2025-07-09 01:11:06]*
