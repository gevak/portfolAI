# Compiler Visualization Portfolio Design

The entire page presents as a live IDE/compiler interface with a dark, sophisticated code editor aesthetic. The background is a deep charcoal (#1e1e1e) with syntax-highlighted "source code" faintly visible as a textured pattern. At the top, Geva Kipper's name appears as a function declaration in vibrant cyan: `function GevaKipper()` followed by a comment line in muted green: `// Currently engineering search infrastructure at Google`. Below this, in italic gray comment text: `/* This portfolio recompiles daily - redesigned by AI, forever evolving */`

The six project boxes are designed as compilation stages, arranged in two columns of three. Each box begins in a "raw code" state - showing actual pseudocode or algorithm snippets related to the project on a slightly lighter charcoal background (#2d2d2d). As you scroll to each box or hover over it, it "compiles" with a wave animation that sweeps from left to right, transforming the code into the polished project presentation. During compilation, colorful syntax highlighting flashes across the text (oranges, purples, yellows) before settling into the final state.

**GlglStats** compiles to show a waveform visualization background pattern with repeating segments highlighted in contrasting colors to represent the song repetition concept. The title appears in bold white, with a small Python logo badge. The description text types out in a monospace font. The links are styled as clickable function calls: `visit_site()` and `watch_presentation()` in bright blue.

**Ahuzat Dibuk** transforms into a heat-map gradient background (green to red) representing parking occupancy. News outlet logos appear as small compiled badges. Links are formatted as array elements: `news_coverage[0]`, `news_coverage[1]`, `original_post` in amber text.

**2D Part Orienting** compiles to reveal a subtle animated geometric polygon in the background that slowly rotates into an oriented position. The C++ designation appears with bracket notation. The link uses the format `#include <project_details>` in purple.

**The Turing Jest** displays with alternating quotation marks in the background, suggesting dialogue/competition. Small bouncing ellipsis dots suggest LLM "thinking". The link appears as `launch_arena()` with a playful emoji-like character rendered in ASCII art.

**Rhymes of Israel** shows a split-screen effect: the left half displays mock "serious" headlines in plain text, while the right shows them transformed into rhyming text with a slight golden glow and casual font styling. The Chrome extension badge appears organically. Link styled as `chrome.install(extension)`.

**The Portfolio Project** (meta-reference) displays as a recursive mirror effect - a smaller version of the entire page within itself, creating a mesmerizing infinite loop visual. The link is simply `return this;` in recursive green.

The seventh box (contact links) is styled as an import statement block:
```
import { GitHub } from 'github.com/gevak'
import { LinkedIn } from 'linkedin.com/in/gevakip'  
import { Facebook } from 'facebook.com/geva.kipper'
```
Each platform name is clickable with its brand color on hover.

At the page bottom, centered in small monospace font: `// Compiled by Claude (Anthropic) on ${current_date}` followed by a live-updating stopwatch showing `Runtime: [X]h [X]m [X]s since epoch 2025-10-23T01:06:05` in a retro digital clock font with slight neon blue glow.

Throughout the page, subtle particle effects drift upward like bits of compiled binary code (0s and 1s in very faint gray). A thin progress bar at the very top fills from left to right as you scroll, colored in a gradient from cyan to magenta, representing compilation progress. All transitions use smooth easing functions, and the overall feel is of watching beautiful, efficient code transform into living, functional projects.
