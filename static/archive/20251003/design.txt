# Escape Room Portfolio Design: "The Cipher Chamber"

The page opens with a dark, atmospheric interface resembling a vintage cryptographer's study. The background features a deep charcoal texture with subtle, animated grid lines that pulse gently like a heartbeat, suggesting hidden patterns waiting to be discovered. At the top, **Geva Kipper**'s name appears in a monospaced font that glitches subtly every few seconds, with the subtitle "Software Engineer at Google, building tools that make sense of the world's data" displayed beneath in a sleeker typeface. Directly below, in amber-colored text reminiscent of old terminal displays, sits the tagline: "This website is re-designed daily by AI and is ever-changing."

The six project boxes are arranged as **locked vault doors** in a 2x3 grid, each featuring a unique puzzle mechanism that must be solved to reveal the project details. Each vault is represented by a 3D-rendered safe door with brass fixtures, combination locks, and LED indicators. The vaults are initially closed, showing only cryptic clues etched into their surfaces:

**Vault 1 (GlglStats)** displays repeating musical notes that pulse rhythmically. The puzzle requires users to click on notes in a pattern that demonstrates compression—clicking repeating sequences causes them to collapse into single symbols. When solved, the vault door swings open with a satisfying metallic sound, revealing the project description in glowing text inside the vault interior. The links appear as glowing buttons labeled "VISIT SITE" and "WATCH PRESENTATION."

**Vault 2 (Ahuzat Dibuk)** shows a grid resembling a city map with parking spaces. Users must drag and arrange car icons into occupied/vacant patterns that match a heat-map silhouette shown faintly in the background. Solving this causes the vault to unlock, displaying the project details with links formatted as news ticker scrolls labeled "CHANNEL 13," "MAKO," and "ORIGINAL POST."

**Vault 3 (2D Part Orienting)** features a polygon shape that users must rotate and position onto a target outline using arrow keys or drag controls. The vault mechanism includes geometric gears that turn as the user manipulates the shape. Success triggers the vault opening, revealing project information with a "READ MORE & CODE" link button.

**Vault 4 (The Turing Jest)** presents a word puzzle where scrambled letters must be rearranged to form a pun. The vault displays "_ _ N N Y  _ _ S I N _ S S" and users must click letter tiles to spell "FUNNY BUSINESS." When complete, the vault reveals project details with a "ENTER THE ARENA" link button.

**Vault 5 (Rhymes of Israel)** shows a serious news headline that users must click syllables to transform into rhyming couplets. Each successful rhyme causes tumblers on the lock to fall into place. The unlocked vault displays the project with an "INSTALL EXTENSION" button styled as a Chrome badge.

**Vault 6 (Portfolio Meta)** displays a miniature recursive version of the entire page. Users must click on the tiny vault representing this vault itself, creating a brief visual recursion effect before the vault opens to reveal "You've found the meta-project!" with a "VIEW SITE" link that humorously points to the current page.

The **seventh section** (social links) appears as a **master control panel** at the bottom of the vault grid, featuring three illuminated switches labeled with GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook icons. These glow in GitHub green, LinkedIn blue, and Facebook blue respectively when hovered, and clicking them opens the corresponding profiles.

At the very bottom, a sleek **credit bar** displays in monospaced font: "Designed by Claude (Anthropic) | AI Architecture of the Day" followed by a **live stopwatch** showing "Time since last rebuild: [XX hours : XX minutes : XX seconds]" counting up from October 3rd, 2025, 01:01:23. The stopwatch digits flip with a mechanical animation reminiscent of old flip clocks.

**Visual flourishes**: When a vault is solved, a beam of light shoots from it to the credit bar at the bottom, as if unlocking secrets contributes to revealing the AI architect. Once all vaults are unlocked, the entire page subtly brightens, and a message appears near the top: "Master Codebreaker—All Secrets Revealed" with a small achievement badge icon. The vaults remain open for easy navigation afterward, but include small reset icons if users want to solve them again.
