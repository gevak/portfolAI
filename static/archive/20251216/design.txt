Design a single-page “AR blueprint desk” experience that feels like you’re looking down at a real engineer’s workbench through a camera feed—except the “objects” are semi-transparent blueprint components that assemble when you hover. The full-bleed background is a dark walnut desk with subtle grain, with a soft vignette and a faint animated “camera scan” noise layer (very low opacity) to sell the AR vibe. Overlaid on top is a blueprint mat: a desaturated deep-navy grid with measurement ticks, drafting marks, and small annotations (in tiny monospace) that gently parallax as the mouse moves, as if the blueprint is floating slightly above the desk. Lighting is realistic: a warm desk lamp glow from the top-left casts soft shadows from every card and component.

At the top center, place a “floating nameplate” UI: **Geva Kipper** in a crisp geometric sans (bold), with a thin blueprint-stroke underline that animates in like it’s being plotted. Directly beneath, a single sentence about his current work at Google (e.g., “Software engineer at Google, currently building and improving large-scale systems that power everyday products.”) styled as a calm, lighter-weight subtitle. Add a second subtitle line: “This portfolio is re-designed each day by AI, so it’s always evolving.” That line should look like an AR system status message—small caps, slightly letter-spaced, with a pulsing dot indicator and a subtle “day seed” stamp (e.g., “AI Layout Seed: YYYY-MM-DD”) to reinforce the ever-changing concept without needing extra sections.

The main content is a single “assembly canvas” occupying the center of the page: a blueprint “exploded view” of an app, with six project modules plus a seventh social module arranged like parts around a central anchor. Each module is a semi-transparent glass/plexi card with blueprint edges—thin cyan stroke, faint corner brackets, and a tiny label tab (like a drafting title block). On initial load, all modules appear in a “deconstructed” state: their internal elements (title, description, links) are offset and slightly separated, with dotted leader lines showing where pieces will snap into place. When hovering a module, it animates like AR-assisted assembly: the title block slides into alignment, the description text “types in” quickly, icons snap into the corners, and a soft shadow intensifies as if it “locks” onto the desk plane. On hover-out, it gently deconstructs again. Each module should also have a minimal “component schematic” behind the text—simple vector lines resembling UI wireframes—so it feels like you’re assembling an interface.

Use a consistent micro-interaction language: (1) “scanline” passes once over a hovered card, (2) blueprint strokes brighten, (3) edges show a brief “calibration” jitter of 1–2px then settle, (4) a small “assembled ✓” badge appears in the card’s title tab. Keep motion elegant and not gimmicky: short durations, eased curves, no loud bounces. Color palette: blueprint cyan + muted white text + occasional warm amber accents (lamp glow, tiny “sticky note” highlights). Typography pairing: modern sans for headings, monospace for labels, IDs, and tiny drafting notes. All content remains fully readable and accessible; hover effects enhance but are not required to access links (tap/click expands on mobile).

Populate the modules as follows (each card has: title, 2–3 sentence description, and clearly styled link buttons that look like “tool tags” clipped to the card).  
1) **GlglStats**: Describe it as a Python project measuring repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression, plus visualizations of repetition patterns in famous songs. Include two link tags: **Site** → https://glglstats.geekip.dev and **PyData TLV Talk (YouTube)** → https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo. Add a subtle background schematic hinting at waveforms and compression blocks.  
2) **Ahuzat Dibuk**: Describe it as Python scraping + data visualization collecting Tel-Aviv parking occupancy and generating heat maps for residents. Include three link tags labeled **News (13tv)**, **News (mako)**, **Original Facebook Post** pointing to the provided URLs. Background schematic: a tiny city grid with heat-map dots.  
3) **2D Part Orienting**: Describe it as a C++ implementation in an open-source computational geometry library, constructing an efficient “push plan” to orient a polygon. Include link tag **Project & Code** → https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/. Background schematic: polygon outlines with arrows and push vectors.  
4) **The Turing Jest**: Describe it as an LMSYS-like arena where LLMs compete at making and explaining puns, rated by users. Include link tag **Visit** → https://jest.geekip.dev. Background schematic: a bracket-style arena diagram and speech bubbles.  
5) **Rhymes of Israel**: Describe it as a Chrome extension using an LLM to rewrite Israeli news headlines into comedic rhymes in the style of a high-school yearbook. Include link tag **Install on Chrome Web Store** → https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eainginjgdkpgolpjniijdihfbeeeklb. Background schematic: headline blocks transforming into rhyming couplets.  
6) **Portfolio (Meta)**: Present it as the portfolio website project itself—“a self-referential build” with daily AI redesign. Include link tag **Home** → https://geekip.dev. Background schematic: nested frames of a webpage inside a webpage, like a drafting recursion.  
7) **Connect** (last box): A clean social card with three prominent icon-buttons (blueprint-outline icons) for **GitHub** (github.com/gevak), **LinkedIn** (linkedin.com/in/gevakip), and **Facebook** (facebook.com/geva.kipper). On hover, each icon “slots in” with a tiny connector animation and shows the full URL in monospace.

Arrange the seven modules so they feel like parts in an exploded assembly around a central “hub” marker (a small circular AR reticle). The hub can optionally show a tiny, non-intrusive “drag to orbit” hint, allowing subtle rearrangement on desktop (modules glide along faint circular guide rails), reinforcing the “desk + AR” playfulness. Ensure mobile collapses into a vertical stack where each card “assembles” on tap, preserving the theme through animation and blueprint accents rather than relying on hover.

At the bottom, add a thin “drafting title block” footer spanning the width like a blueprint legend strip. On the left, include a credit line: “Generated by OpenAI’s ChatGPT (AI design draft)” (or equivalent wording) in small monospace. On the right, place a prominent stopwatch panel styled like an instrument readout with a segmented digital font showing time elapsed since **2025-12-16 01:13:48** in **HH:MM:SS**, ticking every second. Surround it with tiny AR telemetry labels (“elapsed”, “since seed timestamp”) and a faint outline box, as if it’s part of an AR overlay. Keep the overall tone elegant: restrained effects, high contrast readability, and a cohesive “blueprint-on-desk” illusion where every hover feels like assembling a clean, engineered component.
