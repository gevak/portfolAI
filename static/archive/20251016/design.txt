# Terminal Hacker Portfolio Design

## Visual Theme & Core Concept

The page opens with a fullscreen terminal interface featuring a dark background (#0a0e14) with a subtle scanline animation overlay and occasional random pixel flicker to evoke a retro CRT monitor aesthetic. The color scheme uses bright cyan (#00ffff) for primary text, green (#00ff00) for success states and links, amber (#ffb000) for warnings/highlights, and red (#ff0055) for critical elements. A custom monospace font (Fira Code or JetBrains Mono) renders all text with ligature support.

## Initial Loading Sequence

Upon landing, visitors see a boot sequence animation with rapid-fire text displaying system diagnostics, memory checks, and "establishing connection" messages. A progress bar labeled "DECRYPTING PORTFOLIO..." fills over 2-3 seconds. After completion, the text "ACCESS DENIED - AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED" flashes in red, followed by a blinking cursor prompt: `root@geekip:~$` 

Below the prompt, a hint appears in dim gray: `// Type 'help' to view available commands`

## Interactive Command System

The terminal accepts typed commands. Typing "help" reveals a glitchy ASCII art banner with "GEVA KIPPER" in large text, followed by his Google role in cyan: `> Senior Software Engineer @ Google | Building the future of [CLASSIFIED]`. Beneath this, an italicized subtitle appears in amber with a slight glitch effect: `* Site architecture regenerated daily by AI - Never the same twice *`

The help menu lists commands: `scan`, `projects`, `decrypt [1-6]`, `social`, `exit`. Each command triggers unique visual feedback.

## Project Discovery Interface

Executing `scan` initiates a "network scan" animation where six rectangular boxes materialize in a 2x3 grid, each with a loading bar and randomized scan percentage. Each box represents a locked project with only a cryptic filename visible (e.g., "PROJECT_GL.enc", "AHUZAT_DB.dat", "ORIENT_2D.cpp"). When scan completes, boxes pulse with a soft glow and display `[ENCRYPTED]` status.

Typing `decrypt 1` (or clicking a box) triggers a Matrix-style cascading character animation within that box. The encryption "breaks" to reveal the project content. Each decrypted box expands slightly with a smooth CSS transform and displays:

**Box 1 - GlglStats**: Opens with ASCII musical notes raining briefly. Title appears in bright cyan with subtitle "Measuring Musical Monotony Through Compression". Two-line description of the LZ77 compression analysis. Below, two "buttons" styled as terminal commands: `[VISIT_SITE >]` and `[WATCH_TALK >]` with hover effects that add bracket animations.

**Box 2 - Ahuzat Dibuk**: Features a brief animated ASCII heatmap (shifting blocks of color). Description of parking data visualization. Three link sections labeled "As Seen On:" with Channel 13 and Mako logos rendered in ASCII art, plus the Facebook post link styled as a command prompt.

**Box 3 - 2D Part Orienting**: Displays a simple wireframe polygon that rotates slowly. Technical description with C++ syntax highlighting in the text. Single link rendered as `> VIEW_DOCUMENTATION` with a blinking cursor.

**Box 4 - The Turing Jest**: Shows two competing chatbot ASCII faces that occasionally wink or change expression. Description of the LLM pun arena. Link styled as `[ENTER_ARENA]` with playful animation.

**Box 5 - Rhymes of Israel**: Features Hebrew characters that scramble and reform. Description of the Chrome extension with a rhyming headline example. Install button styled as `sudo install rhymes.extension` with a download icon.

**Box 6 - Meta Portfolio**: This box has a recursive screen-within-screen effect, showing a tiny version of the page itself. Self-referential description. Link appears as `./portfolio --recursive` creating an infinite loop visual gag.

**Box 7 - Social Links**: Three icons (GitHub octocat, LinkedIn logo, Facebook 'f') rendered in ASCII art. Each link shows as a command: `ssh git@github.com/gevak`, `connect linkedin.com/in/gevakip`, `ping facebook.com/geva.kipper`. Hover effect shows a "connection established" animation.

## Footer & Credits

At the bottom, a horizontal divider made of terminal characters (═══) separates the footer. Left side shows: `Site generated by: Claude (Anthropic AI) | Build: v2025.10.16` in dim gray. Right side displays a live-updating stopwatch: `Uptime: XXh XXm XXs since 2025-10-16 01:04:56` that counts in real-time with occasional glitch/skip effect for visual interest.

## Ambient Effects

Random typing sounds play subtly on interactions. Occasional "access granted" confirmation beeps. Background features very subtle matrix-rain effect in the margins. Mouse cursor replaced with a crosshair or targeting reticle. All transitions use easing functions that feel like data packet transmission - quick starts with gradual completion.
