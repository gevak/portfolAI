# Subway Map Portfolio Design

The entire page presents as an interactive subway/metro map in the style of the iconic London Underground or Tel Aviv Metropolitan designs, with a warm, gradient background transitioning from deep navy at the top to a sunset orange at the bottom, evoking the Tel Aviv coastline at dusk.

## Header Station

At the top-center, a large circular "interchange station" node contains the name "GEVA KIPPER" in bold, transit-style sans-serif typography. Directly beneath it, a sleek status banner reads "Currently departing from: Google" with a single sentence about his current role. Below that, a digital departure board display (with the classic flip-card aesthetic) shows the subtitle about the AI-redesigned, ever-changing nature of the website, with letters flickering occasionally as if updating.

## The Main Line

A winding, colored metro line snakes through the page in an organic S-curve or figure-8 pattern, connecting seven station nodes. Each station is represented by a rounded rectangle "platform" that expands on hover, revealing its full content. The line itself pulses subtly with an animated gradient, suggesting trains moving through the system.

**Station 1 - GlglStats Line (Purple Line):** The first station platform on the upper-left features a music note icon. The platform card displays the project name in LED-style typography, with a brief description and a small waveform visualization that animates to show repetition patterns. Two "exit" buttons are styled as platform signs - one pointing to the website, another to the PyData presentation video.

**Station 2 - Ahuzat Dibuk Line (Orange Line):** This station features a parking meter icon. The platform shows a miniaturized, animated heat-map with shifting colors. Three "exit" signs link to the two news stories and Facebook post, styled as transfer connections to other lines.

**Station 3 - 2D Part Orienting Line (Green Line):** A geometric polygon icon marks this technical station. The platform displays a subtle animation of a polygon rotating into orientation. A single track leads to the project link, represented as a continuation of the green line.

**Station 4 - The Turing Jest Line (Yellow Line):** A laughing emoji or comedy mask icon. The platform shows two LLM "trains" facing each other with speech bubbles containing pun examples that rotate every few seconds. The exit leads to the jest website.

**Station 5 - Rhymes of Israel Line (Red Line):** A Chrome logo icon with a rhyming couplet symbol. The platform displays sample headlines transforming into rhymes with a typewriter animation effect. The exit is a Chrome-styled button linking to the extension installation.

**Station 6 - Meta Portfolio Line (Blue Line):** An infinity symbol or Möbius strip icon. This station's platform has a mirror-like, recursive visual effect showing a miniature version of the subway map within itself. A self-referential circular arrow links back to the current site.

**Station 7 - Social Terminal (Multi-colored convergence):** The final station is a large terminal hub where all line colors converge. Three platform exits branch out, each styled as departure gates with icons for GitHub (cat), LinkedIn (in), and Facebook (f), with their respective URLs clearly displayed.

## Visual Details

Each station platform card uses frosted glass morphism with subtle shadows and white/light gray text on semi-transparent backgrounds. The metro line connecting them has realistic bezier curves and includes small animated "train" icons that travel along the path continuously. Station numbers appear in circles along the line in traditional metro style.

Small details like "Mind the Gap" warnings, "Way Out" signs in both English and Hebrew, and distance markers between stations add authenticity. The cursor changes to a ticket icon when hovering over clickable elements.

## Footer

At the bottom, a status bar mimics a metro information display, reading "This service designed and operated by [AI Model Name] | System Uptime:" followed by a live-updating stopwatch showing hours:minutes:seconds since 2025-11-08 01:02:51, with the digits styled as seven-segment LED displays in cyan against a dark background.

The entire page is fully responsive, with the subway line reorganizing into a vertical orientation on mobile devices, maintaining all interactive elements and animations.
