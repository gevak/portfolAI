# Recipe Card Portfolio Design

## Overall Layout & Theme

The page opens with a vintage kitchen aesthetic reimagined for the digital age. The background features a warm, cream-colored parchment texture with subtle coffee stains and flour dusting effects created through CSS gradients and opacity layers. A hand-drawn recipe card border frames the entire viewport, complete with ring binder holes along the left edge that cast subtle shadows.

## Header Section

At the top, "Geva Kipper" appears in an elegant script font reminiscent of handwritten recipe titles, rendered in deep espresso brown. Below it, his current work at Google is written in a smaller, typewriter-style monospace font, as if typed onto the recipe card. Immediately beneath, a subtitle in italic serif explains the AI-redesigned nature of the site, styled to look like a penciled annotation in the margin, with a slight rotation of -2 degrees for authenticity.

## Recipe Card Grid

The six project boxes are designed as individual recipe cards scattered across a rustic wooden countertop background. Each card has a slight rotation (varying between -3 and +3 degrees) and casts a realistic drop shadow. The cards have rounded corners with a subtle tea-stained gradient, giving each a unique aged appearance. On hover, cards lift up slightly with an enhanced shadow and straighten to 0 degrees rotation, with a smooth CSS transition.

### Card Structure

Each recipe card displays a project title at the top in the same script font as the header, followed by a "INGREDIENTS:" section listing the technologies (Python, C++, Chrome Extension, etc.) as bullet points with small checkboxes. Below that, a "METHOD:" section contains the project description written in a clean sans-serif font. At the bottom of each card, links appear as recipe tags hanging from twine, created with CSS before/after pseudo-elements, featuring torn paper edges and the link text in a stamp-like font.

**Card 1 (GlglStats)** features a musical note doodle in the corner and ingredients listing "Python," "LZ77 Compression," and "Data Visualization." The YouTube link appears as a vintage TV icon tag, while the project link is styled as a recipe book bookmark.

**Card 2 (Ahuzat Dibuk)** includes a small hand-drawn car illustration and ingredients of "Python," "Web Scraping," and "Heat Maps." The news links appear as newspaper clipping tags, while the Facebook link gets a polaroid-style frame effect.

**Card 3 (2D Part Orienting)** has geometric shapes sketched in the corner with "C++," "Computational Geometry," and "Algorithms" as ingredients. The link tag features a technical drawing aesthetic.

**Card 4 (The Turing Jest)** displays a jester hat doodle with "LLMs," "Puns," and "User Ratings" listed. The link tag has a comedic torn-ticket appearance.

**Card 5 (Rhymes of Israel)** shows a rhyming couplet doodle and lists "Chrome Extension," "LLM," and "Hebrew NLP." The Chrome Web Store link appears as a chrome-finished badge tag.

**Card 6 (Meta Portfolio)** features an Ouroboros-style infinity symbol doodle with "HTML," "CSS," "JavaScript," and "Recursion" as ingredients. The self-reference link is styled as a mirror reflection effect tag.

## Social Links Section

The seventh box breaks the recipe card pattern, appearing instead as a kitchen cutting board in rich walnut tones. Three knife-shaped links are arranged horizontally across it, with GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook icons laser-etched into wooden knife handles. Each knife casts a shadow and has a subtle metallic blade shine effect.

## Footer

At the bottom, a flour-dusted rolling pin stretches across the page width as a visual separator. Below it, centered text credits the AI model in a humble, small italic font that looks like it was written in pencil. The stopwatch is designed as a vintage kitchen timer illustration, with red digital numbers showing elapsed time since October 24, 2025, 01:02:00. The timer updates every second via JavaScript, with the numbers flipping with a subtle animation reminiscent of old flip clocks.

## Interactive Elements

Scattered throughout the background are animated floating elements: tiny code snippets styled as spice particles, semi-transparent recipe notes drifting slowly upward, and occasional steam wisps rising from the bottom of the viewport, all created with CSS animations and JavaScript particle effects. When users scroll, the recipe cards have a subtle parallax effect, moving at slightly different speeds to create depth.
