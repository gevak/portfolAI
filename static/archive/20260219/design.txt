# Space Mission Dashboard — Portfolio Design Brief

## Overall Concept & Atmosphere

The entire single-page site is designed to feel like the command console of a deep-space exploration vessel. The background is a rich, near-black navy (#0a0e1a) filled with a procedurally generated starfield — hundreds of tiny dots of varying opacity and size that drift almost imperceptibly upward using a slow CSS animation, giving the sensation of traveling through space. Occasionally, a shooting star streaks diagonally across the viewport (a thin white line with a glow trail, triggered every 8–12 seconds at random positions via JavaScript). A very subtle blue-purple nebula gradient blush sits fixed in the upper-right and lower-left corners, created with radial gradients at low opacity, giving depth without distraction.

The color palette is anchored by deep navy and charcoal backgrounds, with accent colors drawn from a "mission HUD" aesthetic: electric cyan (#00e5ff) for primary highlights and interactive elements, warm amber/gold (#ffab00) for secondary accents and status indicators, soft white (#e0e6f0) for body text, and occasional pulses of soft red-orange for decorative "alert" details. All text uses a clean monospace font (JetBrains Mono or Space Mono from Google Fonts) for headers and UI labels, paired with Inter or IBM Plex Sans for body paragraphs to maintain readability.

## Top Section — Mission Command Header

At the very top of the page is a thin horizontal bar spanning the full width, styled like a cockpit status strip. It has a 1px border of cyan at the bottom and displays small blinking status indicators: a green dot labeled "SYSTEMS ONLINE," a tiny cycling numeric readout showing the current UTC time, and the text "MISSION: PORTFOLIO v∞" — all in small uppercase monospace type, spaced evenly across the bar. This strip remains fixed at the top of the viewport as the user scrolls (sticky header), grounding every scroll position in the mission metaphor.

Below this strip, centered on the screen, is the developer's name "GEVA KIPPER" rendered in large, bold, slightly letter-spaced uppercase characters (around 3.5rem). The name has a very subtle text-shadow glow in cyan, as though illuminated by a console screen. Directly beneath, in smaller regular-weight text (1.1rem, soft white), appears the sentence describing his current work at Google — something like "Software Engineer at Google" preceded by a small inline icon of a satellite dish or signal wave, giving it a transmission-log feel.

Below that, offset by a thin horizontal rule made of dashes (styled as ── · ── · ── to look like a Morse code divider), sits the subtitle about daily AI redesign. This text is rendered in italic amber/gold at about 0.95rem, reading something contextual like: "⟡ This site is redesigned each day by AI — its form is ever-changing, but the mission endures." The text has a slow, gentle opacity pulse animation (fading between 70% and 100% opacity over 4 seconds) to subtly draw attention and reinforce the "living" nature of the site.

## Navigation — Solar System Orbital Map

Below the header, there is a visually striking interactive solar system map that serves as both decoration and navigation. At the center is a stylized sun — a small radial gradient circle (gold core fading to orange then transparent) with a soft animated glow. Around it, six concentric elliptical orbit paths are drawn as thin, dashed, semi-transparent cyan lines (using SVG ellipses). On each orbit sits a planet — a small circle (roughly 40–50px diameter) each with a unique color and surface texture created purely with CSS gradients and box-shadows:

- **Orbit 1 (innermost):** A warm amber planet with horizontal banding (Jupiter-like) representing GlglStats.
- **Orbit 2:** A teal-green planet with swirling cloud patterns for Ahuzat Dibuk.
- **Orbit 3:** A rocky grey-brown planet with crater-like radial dots for 2D Part Orienting.
- **Orbit 4:** A vibrant purple planet with ring (Saturn-like, ring done with a rotated border ellipse) for The Turing Jest.
- **Orbit 5:** A coral-red planet with a single visible polar cap (white gradient at top) for Rhymes of Israel.
- **Orbit 6:** A planet that looks like a tiny mirror/chrome sphere with a reflected gradient, for the meta portfolio project.

Each planet has a small label beneath it in uppercase monospace at tiny size (0.7rem) with the project name. The planets are positioned along their orbits using absolute/relative positioning within a large centered container (roughly 700px wide, 400px tall, scaling down on mobile). On hover, a planet scales up to 1.3x with a glowing box-shadow ring in its accent color, and the orbit line for that ring brightens to full opacity. Clicking a planet smoothly scrolls the page down to the corresponding project section. A very slow CSS animation rotates each planet along its orbit path (using offset-path or keyframe translations along the ellipse), with inner planets moving faster than outer ones — the motion is extremely slow (full revolution in 60–120 seconds) so it feels ambient rather than distracting.

On mobile viewports (below 768px), the orbital map transforms into a vertical list of planets arranged in a column, each planet sitting on a short horizontal line (like a schematic), maintaining the visual identity without requiring the full orbital layout.

## Project Sections — Mission Log Panels

Below the solar system map, the six project sections are laid out vertically, each separated by generous spacing (around 80–100px). Each section is designed as a "mission briefing panel" — a rectangular card with a dark semi-transparent background (rgba dark blue-grey at 0.6 opacity) sitting on top of the starfield, with a 1px solid border in a muted cyan (at about 30% opacity). The card has slightly clipped corners — the top-left and bottom-right corners are cut at 45-degree angles (achieved with clip-path polygon) giving a sci-fi angular feel rather than standard rounded corners.

Each card has the following internal structure:

**Header bar:** A narrow strip at the top of the card with a slightly lighter background, containing: on the left, a small colored circle matching the planet color from the nav map (acting as a visual anchor/legend), followed by the project name in uppercase bold monospace (1.4rem) in cyan. On the right side of this strip, a "mission designation" label like "MISSION 01" or "SECTOR 01" in small amber text, and a decorative blinking dot (small CSS animation toggling opacity).

**Body area:** The project description is written in the soft white body font (1rem, line-height 1.7) with generous padding. Key technical terms or technologies (like "Python," "LZ77 compression," "C++") are highlighted in cyan as inline styled spans. The descriptions are written as though they are mission briefings — the tone is factual and slightly dramatic.

**Media/Links area:** Below the description text, links are styled as rectangular HUD-style buttons with a 1px cyan border, no fill, uppercase monospace text at 0.8rem, with a small icon before each label (a small arrow or external-link symbol using Unicode or inline SVG). On hover, the button fills with cyan at low opacity and the text brightens to white. Links are arranged in a horizontal row that wraps on mobile.

**Specific section details:**

1. **GlglStats (Planet 1):** The card includes an embedded YouTube video for the PyData TLV talk, displayed in a 16:9 container with a border matching the card style (1px cyan border, angular clip on corners). The video embed sits below the description and above the link buttons. The link buttons read "LAUNCH SITE → glglstats.geekip.dev" and "WATCH TRANSMISSION → PyData TLV Talk." A small decorative waveform graphic (a few sine-wave SVG lines in amber, gently animating their amplitude) sits in the background of this card as a nod to the music/audio analysis theme.

2. **Ahuzat Dibuk (Planet 2):** The description mentions scraping, data visualization, and heat-maps. A small decorative element in the card background: a subtle grid pattern (like a city map grid) in very low opacity lines. The three news/publication links are displayed as distinct buttons labeled something like "NEWS BROADCAST 1 → Channel 13," "NEWS BROADCAST 2 → Mako," and "ORIGINAL SIGNAL → Facebook Post."

3. **2D Part Orienting (Planet 3):** The description covers C++, computational geometry, and the push-plan algorithm. A small decorative polygon shape (a simple irregular pentagon or hexagon) drawn in thin cyan lines sits in the upper-right area of the card, slowly rotating via CSS animation — a direct visual nod to the polygon-orienting subject. The link button reads "ACCESS ARCHIVES → TAU Project Page."

4. **The Turing Jest (Planet 4):** The description covers the LLM arena concept, pun competition, and user rating. A small decorative element: two chat-bubble shapes facing each other, drawn in thin lines (one cyan, one amber), representing the competing LLMs. The link button reads "ENTER THE ARENA → jest.geekip.dev."

5. **Rhymes of Israel (Planet 5):** The description covers the Chrome extension and LLM-powered headline rewriting. A small decorative quill or pen nib icon (SVG, thin lines) in the card corner. The link button reads "INSTALL MODULE → Chrome Web Store."

6. **Portfolio Meta Project (Planet 6):** The description playfully acknowledges the self-referential nature — "You are currently aboard this vessel." The card has a special subtle effect: its border slowly color-cycles through all the planet accent colors (a CSS animation on border-color over 12 seconds), reinforcing that this project encompasses all the others. The link button reads "RETURN TO ORIGIN → geekip.dev."

## Section 7 — Communication Links (Social)

The final section before the footer is styled differently from the project cards. It's presented as a "Communications Array" panel — wider and shorter, centered on the page. The header reads "OPEN CHANNELS" in uppercase cyan. Inside, three links are displayed as larger icon-and-label pairs arranged horizontally (stacking vertically on mobile). Each link is a square-ish block (about 120px wide) containing a simple line-art icon of the platform (GitHub's octocat outline, LinkedIn's "in" mark, Facebook's "f" — all drawn in thin white/cyan lines or Unicode approximations) with the platform name and handle below. On hover, the icon's glow intensifies and the block gets a subtle upward translateY shift (lift effect). The links point to github.com/gevak, linkedin.com/in/gevakip, and facebook.com/geva.kipper.

## Footer — AI Credit & Mission Clock

The footer sits at the very bottom with a top border styled as the same dashed Morse-code divider used earlier. It has two lines of centered text. The first line credits the AI model in small (0.85rem) amber italic text: something like "Designed by Claude (Anthropic) — an AI co-pilot on this mission." The second line is the live mission elapsed timer. It's styled in monospace cyan at about 1.1rem, formatted as "T+ 000d 00h 00m 00s" (days, hours, minutes, seconds), counting upward from the epoch 2026-02-19 01:29:55 UTC. JavaScript calculates the difference between now and that timestamp and updates every second. The numbers have a subtle flicker effect (a very fast, barely perceptible opacity jitter on the seconds digit only) to make it feel like a live digital readout.

## Responsive & Interaction Details

The entire page uses smooth scroll behavior. Scroll-triggered animations bring each project card into view: cards start with opacity 0 and a translateY of 30px, and transition to full opacity and position as they enter the viewport (using IntersectionObserver). The starfield background is rendered on a full-page canvas element behind all content using a simple JavaScript particle system — each star is a point with randomized x, y, size, base opacity, and a very slow upward drift speed; the canvas redraws at 30fps. The shooting star effect is also drawn on this canvas. On mobile, the star count is reduced by half for performance. All interactive elements have clear focus states (cyan outline glow) for keyboard accessibility. The page uses no external libraries or frameworks — everything is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
