# RPG Character Sheet Portfolio Design

## Overall Theme & Aesthetic

The website presents as a weathered parchment character sheet floating against a deep purple-black void filled with slowly drifting particle effects resembling magical sparks. The entire page has a subtle parallax depth effect—the parchment layer moves slightly as the user scrolls or moves their cursor, creating a sense of physicality. The color palette combines aged cream and sepia tones for the parchment elements with vibrant accent colors: electric blue for links, gold for highlights, and deep crimson for important stats. Typography uses a combination of a decorative medieval-style font for headers ("Cinzel Decorative") and a clean monospace font ("Fira Code") for technical content, bridging fantasy and code aesthetics.

## Header Section

At the top of the parchment, an ornate banner unfurls with the name **GEVA KIPPER** rendered in large, gilded letters with a subtle metallic shimmer animation. Below, in smaller italic text styled like a character class description: "Level ?? Software Engineer • Currently wielding code at Google". A decorative horizontal divider made of interlocking Celtic-style knots separates this from the subtitle. The subtitle appears as handwritten marginalia in a slightly tilted, cursive font: "※ This character sheet is rewritten daily by an AI scribe—no two visits are ever quite the same ※". Small animated quill-scratch marks occasionally appear near this text.

## Main Stats Panel (Left Sidebar Element)

A vertical strip along the left edge displays core "attributes" in hexagonal badges: **STR** (Systems), **INT** (Algorithms), **WIS** (Data), **DEX** (Frontend), **CON** (Backend), **CHA** (Communication). Each shows a numerical value out of 20 with a filled progress bar. These values subtly pulse with a soft glow. Below the attributes, a circular "XP Ring" shows total experience points with an animated fill, and text showing "Years Active: 10+".

## Project Cards (The Six Boxes)

The six project sections are presented as **Quest Log entries** arranged in a 2x3 grid on larger screens, stacking vertically on mobile. Each card appears as a separate piece of parchment pinned to the main sheet with an illustrated wax seal in the corner (each seal has a unique icon matching the project theme). On hover, cards lift slightly with a drop shadow deepening, and the wax seal rotates gently.

**Card 1 - GlglStats (Music Note Seal)**
Header styled as quest title: "Quest: GlglStats". A small Python snake icon badge. Description text explains the LZ77 compression analysis of Israeli pop charts. Below the description, a miniature waveform visualization animates continuously, representing repetition patterns. Links appear as glowing rune buttons: one labeled "View the Charts" (linking to the site) and another "Watch the Tale" (linking to the PyData video, with a small play icon). The video link has a film reel decorative element.

**Card 2 - Ahuzat Dibuk (Car/Parking Seal)**
Quest title with a small parking meter pixel art icon. Description of the Tel-Aviv parking scraping project. A tiny animated heatmap grid pulses in the corner, cycling through occupancy colors (green to red). Three scroll-styled links: "The News Spreads - Channel 13", "The News Spreads - Mako", and "The Original Proclamation - Facebook". Each link has a small newspaper or speech bubble icon.

**Card 3 - 2D Part Orienting (Geometric Polygon Seal)**
Quest title with C++ badge icon. Description of the computational geometry algorithm. A small animated polygon slowly rotates and gets "pushed" into alignment by animated arrows, demonstrating the concept. Single link styled as an ancient tome: "The Sacred Texts & Incantations" pointing to the TAU project page.

**Card 4 - The Turing Jest (Jester Hat Seal)**
Quest title with comedy/tragedy mask micro-icon. Description of the LLM pun arena. Small animated thought bubbles with "Ha!" appear periodically. A decorative rating system showing 5 quill feathers. Link button: "Enter the Arena" with a versus/battle icon.

**Card 5 - Rhymes of Israel (Scroll with Quill Seal)**
Quest title with Chrome browser icon stylized as a shield. Description of the headline-rewriting extension. A sample "before/after" mini-display shows a boring headline transforming into a rhyme with sparkle effects. Link: "Acquire This Enchantment" pointing to the Chrome store.

**Card 6 - This Very Realm (Infinity/Loop Seal)**
Quest title with a recursive symbol icon. Self-referential description acknowledging the meta nature. A small mirror or portal frame decoration with an infinite regression effect hinting at recursion. Link: "You Are Already Here" (geekip.dev) with a playful looping animation on the text.

## Social Links Section (Card 7 - The Guild Connections)

This final section appears as a separate ornate banner at the bottom of the quest grid, styled as a "Guild Affiliations" panel. Three circular portrait frames arranged horizontally contain animated icons: the GitHub Octocat rendered in a medieval woodcut style, the LinkedIn "in" as an illuminated manuscript letter, and the Facebook "f" styled as a heraldic symbol. Each circle has a decorative frame with the platform name below in small caps. On hover, the icons glow and a tooltip ribbon unfurls showing the full URL.

## Footer Section

The footer sits below the parchment edge, in the void space, styled with a subtle gradient fade. Centered text reads: "This character sheet was inscribed by Claude (Anthropic) • A humble AI scribe". Below this, a mechanical stopwatch visualization: an actual illustrated clock face with moving hands (seconds hand ticks visibly), displaying "Time Since Last Inscription:" followed by a dynamically updating counter showing hours, minutes, and seconds since December 4th, 2025, 01:08:11. The stopwatch has brass/copper steampunk styling with visible gears that rotate, blending fantasy with mechanical precision. Small cogwheel decorations flank the timer.

## Interactive Elements & Animations

- Cursor changes to a quill icon when hovering over interactive elements
- A very subtle paper texture grain shifts slightly with mouse movement (noise overlay)
- Occasionally, a small animated sprite (a fairy, wisp, or floating rune) drifts across the screen
- Cards have a gentle "breathing" animation when idle—a barely perceptible scale pulse
- Scroll progress is indicated by an illuminated border that "fills in" the parchment edge as you scroll down
- Links emit small particle bursts of magical sparks when clicked
- The XP bar in the stats panel occasionally gains "+1 XP" with a small pop animation (just for whimsy)

## Responsive Behavior

On mobile, the left stats sidebar collapses into a horizontal bar at the top that can be tapped to expand. Project cards stack in a single column with slightly reduced decorative elements for performance. The parchment texture simplifies, and particle effects reduce in density. The footer timer remains prominent and fully functional.
