# File Explorer OS Portfolio - Design Specification

## Overall Theme & Layout

The website mimics a nostalgic late-90s/early-2000s operating system file explorer window, but with modern glassmorphism and smooth animations. The entire page is contained within a draggable OS window frame with classic minimize/maximize/close buttons (non-functional, purely aesthetic). The window has a title bar reading "Geva Kipper - Portfolio Explorer" with a small folder icon.

The background behind the window shows a blurred desktop wallpaper featuring a gradient mesh of blues and purples with floating geometric shapes, giving depth to the interface. The main explorer window uses a frosted glass effect with subtle transparency, revealing hints of the desktop behind.

## Header Section

The explorer window's toolbar area contains navigation breadcrumbs styled as a file path: `C:\Users\GevaKipper\Projects\`. Below this, a address bar displays "Geva Kipper" in a monospace font as the main heading, followed by his current work at Google in smaller text within the same bar. Directly beneath, a status bar in yellow-tinted background (like Windows warning bars) contains the subtitle about the AI-redesigned website, with a small rotating sparkle icon animation.

## Main Content Area - File Explorer Grid

The main viewing area displays a grid of folder icons (7 total) arranged in a classic icon view with 3 columns. Each folder is rendered as a 3D isometric folder icon with custom colors and small preview thumbnails visible on the folder face, suggesting the content within. On hover, folders lift slightly with a shadow effect and gently rock side-to-side.

**Folder 1 - "GlglStats"** (Coral/salmon colored): Shows a waveform pattern on its face. When clicked, the folder opens into a panel revealing project details, the embedded YouTube video thumbnail, and links styled as file shortcuts (.url icons).

**Folder 2 - "Ahuzat_Dibuk"** (Teal colored): Displays a tiny heatmap graphic on the folder. Opens to show news article links as newspaper icons and the Facebook link as a social media file icon.

**Folder 3 - "2D_Part_Orienting"** (Steel blue): Features geometric shapes on its surface. Expands to show technical documentation styled as .cpp and .txt file listings with the project link.

**Folder 4 - "The_Turing_Jest"** (Golden yellow): Shows comedy/tragedy masks icon. Opens to reveal the project description with the link styled as an executable (.exe) file with a jester hat icon.

**Folder 5 - "Rhymes_of_Israel"** (Purple gradient): Displays a Chrome logo badge. Unfolds to show extension details with the Chrome Web Store link as a .crx installer file.

**Folder 6 - "Portfolio_Recursion"** (Prismatic rainbow shimmer): Has an infinity symbol on it. Opens to show meta commentary with the self-referential link creating a visual loop effect.

**Folder 7 - "Social_Links"** (Classic gray): Shows connected nodes icon. Expands to display GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook links as desktop shortcut icons with their respective platform logos.

## Interaction Design

Clicking a folder triggers an animation where it opens (top flap lifting) and a properties panel slides out from the right side of the explorer window, styled like a Windows properties dialog. This panel contains the project description, links formatted as files with appropriate icons, and any embedded content. A small X button closes the panel and returns to the grid view. Multiple folders cannot be open simultaneously.

The left sidebar of the explorer shows a directory tree view with "Quick Access" favorites including all project names, allowing instant navigation. Each folder in the main area has a small label underneath in system font.

## Footer Section

At the bottom of the explorer window, a status bar spans the full width showing: on the left, "7 items" with small file/folder icons; in the center, credit text reading "Site generated by [AI model name] on [date]" in subtle gray; on the right, a live stopwatch displaying time elapsed since 2025-10-29 01:07:54 in format "Uptime: XXh XXm XXs" with a small clock icon, updating every second.

## Color Palette & Typography

Primary colors: Deep navy (#1e2875) for window frame, soft whites (#f5f5f5) for backgrounds, accent colors unique to each folder. Typography uses Segoe UI for body text and Consolas for file paths and technical elements. All interactive elements have smooth transitions (300ms ease-in-out) and subtle hover states with color shifts and scale transforms.
