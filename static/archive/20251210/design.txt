# Terminal Portfolio Design: "GEVA_OS v2.5"

## Overall Concept

The entire viewport presents as a retro-futuristic terminal interface with a dark background (#0a0a0f) featuring subtle, slowly drifting scanlines and occasional CRT screen flicker effects. The aesthetic blends 1980s green phosphor terminals with modern glassmorphism touches—creating something that feels both nostalgic and cutting-edge.

## Header Section

At the top, a terminal prompt-style header displays:
```
geva@portfolio:~$ whoami
```
Below this, the name "GEVA KIPPER" renders character-by-character with a typing animation in large, glowing monospace font (IBM Plex Mono or similar) in phosphor green (#00ff41). Beneath the name, a blinking cursor followed by: "Software Engineer @ Google" fades in after the name finishes typing.

A smaller line below in amber (#ffb000) with a pulsing glow states: "// This interface regenerates daily via AI — no two visits are identical //"

## Command Input Interface

Below the header sits a functional command input field styled as a terminal prompt: `geva@portfolio:~$ _` with a blinking block cursor. When visitors type, suggested commands appear as ghost text. Valid commands include: `ls projects`, `cat about`, `help`, `clear`, and clicking any project box executes `cat [project-name]`.

## Project Grid Layout

Six project boxes arranged in a 3x2 grid float with subtle parallax depth on scroll. Each box appears as a "terminal window" with a draggable title bar (purely decorative), minimize/maximize/close buttons that trigger playful animations when hovered, and a semi-transparent dark glass background with green border glow.

### Box 1: GlglStats
Title bar reads: `[glglstats.py]`
Inside, animated waveform visualization made of ASCII characters (█▓▒░) pulses rhythmically. Text describes the LZ77 compression analysis of Israeli pop songs. Two buttons styled as terminal commands: `[▶ WATCH TALK]` linking to the YouTube video and `[→ LAUNCH]` linking to the site. Small "PyData TLV" badge glows in corner.

### Box 2: Ahuzat Dibuk
Title bar: `[parking_scraper.py]`
Features a miniature animated heatmap grid made of colored ASCII blocks, cycling through occupancy states. Parking lot icons (P) flash between green/yellow/red. Three link buttons styled as `[📺 CH13]`, `[📰 MAKO]`, `[👥 FB POST]` arranged horizontally.

### Box 3: 2D Part Orienting
Title bar: `[orient.cpp]`
Contains an SVG animation of a simple polygon being "pushed" and rotating into orientation—rendered in wireframe neon style with vertex coordinates displayed. Link styled as `[⟨/⟩ VIEW CODE @ TAU]`.

### Box 4: The Turing Jest
Title bar: `[jest_arena.exe]`
Shows two "competing" AI avatars (simple geometric robot faces) with speech bubbles containing rotating sample puns. A rating bar with star icons animates between them. Link: `[🎭 ENTER ARENA]`.

### Box 5: Rhymes of Israel
Title bar: `[headlines.crx]`
Displays a mock browser chrome window showing a news headline that transforms (with strikethrough animation) into a rhyming couplet. Chrome extension icon pulses. Link: `[⬇ INSTALL EXTENSION]`.

### Box 6: This Portfolio
Title bar: `[portfolio.html]` 
A recursive visual: a tiny rendering of the terminal interface itself, creating a "screen within screen" effect that zooms infinitely when hovered. Meta-commentary text: "You are here." Link: `[↺ RECURSE]` pointing to geekip.dev.

### Box 7: Connect
Title bar: `[socials.sh]`
Three large icons rendered in ASCII art style that reconstruct themselves on hover. GitHub (octocat outline), LinkedIn (in logo), Facebook (f logo). Each glows its brand color on hover. Links are displayed as terminal paths: `~/github`, `~/linkedin`, `~/facebook`.

## Footer

A bottom bar styled as terminal status line shows: `Generated by Claude (Anthropic) | Uptime: XX:XX:XX` where the uptime counter ticks live since December 10, 2025 01:09:59. The elapsed time displays in HH:MM:SS format, updating every second, with subtle number-flip animations.

## Interactive Elements & Polish

- Typing any text triggers soft mechanical keyboard sounds
- Random "system messages" occasionally appear in corners like `[Memory OK]` or `[Rendering complete]`
- Easter egg: typing `sudo rm -rf /` triggers a fake "deletion" animation before everything reconstructs
- Subtle vignette darkening at screen edges enhances CRT feel
- All transitions use ease-out timing for snappy, responsive feel
