# IDE Theme Portfolio Design

The website mimics a modern code editor interface, specifically drawing inspiration from VS Code's dark theme with carefully chosen accent colors. The viewport fills the entire screen with a rich dark background (#1e1e1e), creating an authentic IDE experience. At the very top, a menu bar displays "File Edit View Go Run Terminal Help" in subtle gray text, purely aesthetic but adding realism.

Below the menu bar, a tab bar spans the width of the screen containing seven tabs. Each tab displays a filename: "about.md", "glglstats.py", "ahuzat_dibuk.py", "2d_orient.cpp", "turing_jest.js", "rhymes.html", "portfolio.css", and "links.json". The currently active tab has a darker background matching the main content area, while inactive tabs are slightly lighter. Each tab includes a small colored circle (like modified file indicators) - different colors for different file types (blue for Python, orange for C++, yellow for JS, etc.). A subtle close button (×) appears on hover for each tab, though non-functional, adding to the authenticity.

The main content area is divided into two sections: a narrow left sidebar (20% width) acting as a file explorer, and the main editor pane (80% width). The sidebar has a dark gray background (#252526) with a header reading "EXPLORER" in uppercase gray letters. Below it, an expandable tree structure shows a folder icon labeled "geva-kipper-portfolio" with all the project files nested underneath, matching the tab filenames. The currently active file is highlighted with a subtle blue background.

The editor pane displays content based on the active tab. When "about.md" is selected (default on load), the content shows line numbers on the left (in dark gray, #858585) and the main text area styled as a markdown preview. The developer's name "Geva Kipper" appears as a large heading (48px, #d4d4d4) with syntax highlighting colors - the markdown # symbol in a muted purple. Below, a single line in italics describes his current work at Google, styled in a lighter gray (#cccccc). A horizontal separator line (comment-style, in green #6a9955) precedes the subtitle about the AI-redesigned website, which appears as a blockquote with a left border in accent blue (#007acc).

Switching between tabs creates a smooth fade transition (200ms). Each project tab displays its content as if it were actual code with syntax highlighting. For Python files (GlglStats and Ahuzat Dibuk), the layout uses Python comment blocks (triple quotes) for descriptions, with function definitions for features. Links appear as decorators (@link) above function names. The video link for GlglStats displays as an embedded thumbnail with a play icon overlay, styled as an inline image comment. News links for Ahuzat Dibuk are formatted as a list within a docstring, each with a small favicon-style icon.

The C++ file (2D Part Orienting) uses C++ style with namespace declarations and class definitions, where the description sits in a multi-line comment block. The JavaScript file (Turing Jest) uses ES6 syntax with const declarations and arrow functions. The HTML file (Rhymes of Israel) shows actual HTML markup with the Chrome extension link as an anchor tag. The CSS file (portfolio.css) presents the self-referential portfolio link as a CSS rule with the URL in a background-image property.

The "links.json" tab displays a properly formatted JSON object with three properties: "github", "linkedin", and "facebook", each containing the respective URLs. Each link has a small icon (GitHub octocat, LinkedIn logo, Facebook 'f') that appears when hovering, styled as if they were JSON value decorations.

At the bottom of the screen, a status bar stretches full-width with a distinctive blue background (#007acc) on the left third, fading to the dark background on the right. The left section displays "Claude (AI)" with a small robot emoji icon, followed by "UTF-8" and "Markdown" as you'd see in VS Code. The right section shows the timestamp "Updated: 2025-11-10 01:09:20" followed by a live stopwatch displaying the elapsed time in the format "Runtime: XXh XXm XXs" that updates every second using JavaScript.

Hover effects throughout include subtle highlights on tab bars, underlines appearing beneath links with a typing animation effect, and line numbers that brighten when hovering over code lines. The scrollbar is custom-styled to match VS Code's thin, dark scrollbar design. Font choice is JetBrains Mono for all code content and system-ui for the sidebar, maintaining the authentic IDE experience while ensuring readability.
