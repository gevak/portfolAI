Here is the design for a unique, out-of-the-box portfolio website.

### **Website Design: The AI Assistant**

**Overall Concept:**
The entire single-page website is a stylized chat interface. On loading the site, the user is greeted by an AI assistant that initiates a conversation. The "chat" unfolds as the user scrolls, revealing the story and projects of Geva Kipper. The interaction is guided, with the AI presenting information in message bubbles and the "user's" replies (which are pre-defined buttons) driving the conversation forward. The aesthetic is clean, futuristic, and elegant, blending a dark-mode terminal feel with modern web design.

**Visual Theme & Layout:**
*   **Background:** A deep charcoal (#1A1A1A) background with a very subtle, slowly moving grid of faint cyan dots, giving a sense of a digital, intelligent space without being distracting.
*   **Chat Log:** The content flows vertically like a chat log. AI messages are left-aligned, while the user's interactive "reply" prompts are right-aligned. The entire page scrolls as one continuous conversation.
*   **Typography:** AI messages use a crisp monospaced font like 'Fira Code' or 'Roboto Mono' in a light cyan color. All other text uses a clean, modern sans-serif like 'Inter' in off-white.

### **The Conversational Flow**

**1. The Greeting (Top of Page):**
The page loads with a single, left-aligned chat bubble that animates into view, with text appearing as if being typed live, complete with a blinking cursor.

> **AI:** `Initializing portfolio for Geva Kipper...`
> **AI:** `Hello. I am Geva's portfolio assistant. He is currently at Google, helping develop the future of search.`

A second bubble appears just below it.

> **AI:** `My design and structure are regenerated daily, so this experience is unique to you. How may I guide you?`

Below this, three pill-shaped, right-aligned buttons appear, glowing slightly on hover. These are the user's "replies".

`[Show me the projects]` `[Just the key links, please]`

**2. The Project Showcase (Main Content):**
When the user clicks `[Show me the projects]`, the previous buttons fade, the screen scrolls down slightly, and the AI continues the conversation.

> **AI:** `Excellent. Let's start with a project that combines data science with Israeli pop music.`

A large, rich-media chat bubble appears. This bubble acts as the section/box for the project.

*   **Project 1: GlglStats**
    *   **Bubble Content:** A card-like bubble with a clear header: **GlglStats**.
    *   **Description:** "A Python project measuring the repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression, featuring visualizations of repetition patterns."
    *   **Links:** Below the text, a row of two icon-based buttons:
        *   A "Live Site" button with a link icon, pointing to `https://glglstats.geekip.dev`.
        *   A "PyData Talk" button with a play icon, pointing to the YouTube video.

After this project card, a new user reply button appears: `[Interesting. Next project?]`

This pattern repeats for each project. Clicking the "Next project" button scrolls the page further down the chat log and reveals the next AI message and project card.

*   **Project 2: Ahuzat Dibuk**
    *   **AI Message:** `Next, a civic-tech project that made headlines: tracking parking occupancy in Tel Aviv.`
    *   **Bubble Content:** Header: **Ahuzat Dibuk**. Description: "A Python scraping and data visualization project generating heat-maps of Tel-Aviv parking lot occupancy."
    *   **Links:** Three icon buttons: "Channel 13 News", "Mako News", and "Original Post" (with a Facebook icon).

*   **Project 3: 2D Part Orienting**
    *   **AI Message:** `Now for something more theoretical: an algorithm in computational geometry.`
    *   **Bubble Content:** Header: **2D Part Orienting**. Description: "A C++ implementation of an efficient algorithm for constructing a 'push plan' to orient a polygon, contributed to an open-source library."
    *   **Links:** One button: "Code & Details".

*   **Project 4: The Turing Jest**
    *   **AI Message:** `From geometry to humor. Geva also explores the creative side of AI.`
    *   **Bubble Content:** Header: **The Turing Jest**. Description: "An LLM arena where AI models compete at making and explaining puns, with user ratings determining the wittiest AI."
    *   **Links:** One button: "Visit The Arena".

*   **Project 5: Rhymes of Israel**
    *   **AI Message:** `Continuing with creative AI, here's a browser extension that finds the poetry in the daily news.`
    *   **Bubble Content:** Header: **Rhymes of Israel**. Description: "A Chrome extension using an LLM to rewrite Israeli news headlines into comedic, highschool-yearbook-style rhymes."
    *   **Links:** One icon button with the Chrome logo: "Install Extension".

*   **Project 6: The Website Itself (Meta)**
    *   **AI Message:** `Finally, the last project is... this very conversation.`
    *   **Bubble Content:** A special, glowing-cyan-bordered card. Header: **The AI Portfolio**. Description: "This meta-project is a single-page portfolio designed as an AI assistant to guide visitors through Geva's work."
    *   **Links:** One button: `[View This Conversation's Source]`, linking to `https://geekip.dev`.

**3. Social Connections:**
After the final project, the AI delivers its closing statement.

> **AI:** `This concludes the project overview. You can connect with Geva or explore more of his work via his professional and social profiles.`

A final, wide bubble appears, containing three large, clean, and separated icons for **GitHub**, **LinkedIn**, and **Facebook**, each linking to the respective profile.

**4. The Footer:**
This is a static bar fixed to the bottom of the viewport, separated by a thin, glowing cyan line.

*   **Left Side:** In small, subtle sans-serif text: `Site concept & design by a GPT-4-class AI.`
*   **Right Side:** A live stopwatch with a digital monospaced font, displaying "Time since last redesign:" followed by a counter (HH:MM:SS) dynamically counting up from `2025-09-23 01:02:07 UTC`.
