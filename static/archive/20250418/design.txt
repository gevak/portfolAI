**Overall Concept:**
The website presents a clean, minimalist interface overlaying a constantly evolving, abstract generative art background. The background is the primary visual focus, generated by code and subtly changing its patterns, colors, and textures throughout the day, reflecting the "daily AI redesign" theme. The content is presented clearly on top, ensuring readability while allowing the dynamic background to create a unique atmosphere.

**Layout & Styling:**
A single-page vertical scroll layout. The background is full-screen, featuring algorithmically generated visuals â€“ think slowly morphing geometric shapes, intricate line work dissolving and reforming, or subtle particle fields shifting in color and density. The color palette for the generative art changes daily, potentially influencing subtle accent colors in the foreground UI for that day.

The foreground content resides within containers that have a slight translucency or frosted glass effect, allowing the background art to be partially visible without compromising text legibility. Typography is crisp and modern, using a clean sans-serif font hierarchy. White space is used generously to maintain the minimalist feel.

**Header Section:**
At the top, centered or left-aligned:
*   **Geva Kipper** (Prominent font size)
*   Software Engineer at Google, focusing on [brief, specific aspect of his work]. (Smaller font size, single line)
*   *This website's generative design is algorithmically redesigned each day.* (Subtly styled subtitle, perhaps italicized or slightly different weight/color, placed below the name/role).

**Content Sections (Boxes):**
Five distinct content sections appear sequentially as the user scrolls down. These are presented as clean, rectangular panels with minimal borders or subtle shadows, floating above the dynamic background.
