# Voice-Command Navigated Portfolio Design Concept

## Theme: Code Terminal with Voice Navigation

The website is designed as an interactive terminal interface where visitors navigate using voice commands based on coding terminology. The terminal aesthetic is sophisticated - dark background with glowing text and subtle syntax highlighting colors.

## Header & Introduction
- A terminal-like header displays "Geva Kipper@Google:~$" with a blinking cursor
- Below it, a single sentence about Geva's current work at Google appears as if being typed in real-time
- A distinctive subtitle explains that the website is redesigned daily by AI, making it ever-evolving
- A floating microphone icon pulses gently, indicating voice command capability
- Visual cue text suggests commands like "run project.list", "cd GlglStats", or "help" to navigate

## Voice Command Functionality
- A discreet tutorial popup appears on first visit showing sample commands like "import project1" or "execute portfolio.view"
- Voice commands trigger smooth transitions between sections with terminal-style loading animations
- Command syntax is visible at the bottom of the screen, changing contextually based on the current section

## Project Sections
Each project appears as a terminal output block with:
- Project name displayed as a command result (e.g., "$ show GlglStats")
- Description formatted with syntax highlighting for key technical terms
- Links styled as command-line parameters
- Media (videos, screenshots) appear in "windows" that slide in from the edge when commanded

## Specific Design Elements
- A visualization of sound waves appears when the voice recognition is active
- Transitions between sections mimic terminal commands executing (loading dots, progress bars)
- Code snippets from each project fade in and out in the background
- Each project section has a unique accent color derived from its logo or theme
- Interactive elements respond with terminal feedback (e.g., "Opening external link...")

## Navigation Experience
- Voice saying "run GlglStats.info" expands the GlglStats section
- Saying "list projects" shows all five boxes in a compact view
- Saying "clear" returns to the homepage view
- Command history is visible in a scrollable sidebar

## Footer
- Terminal-style footer shows: "[AI-Model-Name] â€¢ Generated: [date]"
- Running stopwatch displaying time since 2025-04-06 01:05:41 in terminal timestamp format
- Social links appear as command shortcuts (e.g., "$ open github.com/gevak")

## Responsive Design
- Mobile version transforms into a more compact terminal with swipeable project "cards"
- Voice commands remain functional but with added touch navigation options
- Command suggestions appear adaptively based on screen size and interaction pattern

This design creates an immersive, developer-focused experience that showcases both the projects and coding skills in an innovative way that feels both familiar to developers and intriguing to non-technical visitors.
