The website opens as if the user has just logged into a hacker terminal dashboard. The background is a deep matte black, scattered subtly with faint grid lines fading into darkness, giving the illusion of depth. Animated green “system logs” scroll continuously in the background at variable speeds, evoking the feel of a live console. Small bursts of glowing ASCII characters occasionally flicker and vanish like glitches, reinforcing the hacker aesthetic. The logs aren’t just static—some lines occasionally highlight Geva’s name, project titles, or random “AI redesign” system update messages to tie the background into the site’s story.  

At the very top, a neon-green command line prompt blinks:  
**`[root@geekip.dev]$`** followed by the text *“Geva Kipper — Software Engineer, currently building at Google.”*  
Just beneath, in slightly dimmer text, a subtitle reads: *“This portfolio is redesigned daily by AI — always evolving, never static.”* This subtitle appears as if it’s being typed out in real time, retro terminal style.  

The central interface is structured as six floating “system panels” arranged in a responsive 3x2 grid (collapsing gracefully into a stacked view on mobile). Each panel looks like a glowing, beveled monitor window with sharp edges, subtle green scanline textures, and tiny “status lights” in the corner. When users hover over a panel, fuzzy glitch effects ripple across the text, and the panel expands slightly as though it’s powering up.  

Inside each panel:  
- **GlglStats**: Displays as a "Data Compression: Analyzing Pop-Chart Input…" log header, underneath which the project description glows in light green monospace. Below, clickable links are styled like file paths (e.g., `> open glglstats.geekip.dev`, `> play video: PyData_TLV.mp4`). The embedded YouTube video sits inside a “terminal playback” frame.  
- **Ahuzat Dibuk**: Introduced with a blinking label: *“[Monitor: Urban Parking Heatmaps]”*. The description appears, and external links display as log outputs with “source verified” tags. The Facebook publication link appears as *“user_generated.log”*.  
- **2D Part Orienting**: Styled as *“Algorithmic Geometry Engine Online”*. Clicking the link feels like executing a script. An SVG outline of a polygon animates faintly in the background of the panel.  
- **The Turing Jest**: Title styled with a cheeky *“[Error 404: Seriousness Not Found]”*. The site link appears within a jokey system alert pop-up block. The panel flashes mild rainbow “pun sparks” randomly across the border while idling.  
- **Rhymes of Israel**: Framed as *“Running Headlines -> Transform: Rhyme( satirical )”*. The Chrome extension’s install link shows as an input command (`$ install rhymes.israel`). A sample rhymed headline flickers briefly before being scrambled into glitch text.  
- **Meta Portfolio Project**: This panel is set apart with inverted white-on-black monospace. It shows the link `https://geekip.dev` and surrounds it in animated recursive ASCII borders, referencing that this very site is self-referential.  

The **final panel** acts as a “network connections” console output, showing links to GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Each displays in-line with ASCII art icons (e.g., a cat for GitHub) and pulses faint light when hovered.  

At the very bottom, stretching the full viewport width, a persistent “system footer” glows in a darker green. It reads: *“Generated by OpenAI, model GPT-4o”* followed by a real-time stopwatch counting upward since **2025-08-25 01:06:33**. The timer appears as if it’s a system uptime log, updated live with ticking numerals, adding life to the page’s terminal feel.  

Transitions are snappy but slightly noisy, with fade/flicker effects instead of clean CSS easing, amplifying the hacker console theme. Soft electronic blip sounds may optionally accompany hover states. On mobile, the design compresses into a vertical timeline, like a console dump, with each project presented sequentially as expanding terminal outputs.  

The overall atmosphere: sleek, surreal, cyberpunk-inspired—half high-tech hacker log, half living AI reimagining. A portfolio that feels alive, always mid-debug.
