A sleek, dark-themed website with a minimalist interface. The entire page is initially obscured by a semi-transparent black overlay, revealing only the centered title: "Geva Kipper" and his subtitle: "Software Engineer at Google, exploring the intersection of AI and creativity." Below, a brief sentence explains: "This portfolio is a living entity, re-designed each day by AI and is thus ever-changing."

The primary interface is a grid of six identical, featureless black boxes arranged in a 3x2 pattern, each representing a locked "drawer" of the puzzle box. A small, pulsing cyan LED glows in the center of each box. When a visitor clicks a box, its LED turns amber and a small, elegant modal window appears overlaying the site. The modal presents a unique, small coding puzzle (e.g., a tiny JavaScript function to fix, a one-line algorithm to complete, or a regex pattern to write). A code editor is embedded in the modal for the user to type their solution.

Upon submitting a correct solution, the modal closes. The corresponding box on the grid undergoes a transformation: its front panel slides away with a subtle mechanical sound (via the Web Audio API), the LED turns a steady green, and the project content is revealed inside the now-open drawer. The content is displayed on a digital "tag" within the drawer, featuring the project title, a concise description, and the relevant links styled as interactive buttons. The seventh "social" box is unlocked by solving a simple meta-puzzle that requires using a clue from one of the other six project descriptions.

A digital stopwatch at the bottom of the page meticulously counts up from the specified date and time. Directly above it, in small, discreet type, is the credit: "Architectonic Intelligence: Site conceptualized and designed by GPT-4."
