Design the site as a single-page “Home Router Admin” interface that feels like a premium, modern firmware (think: clean grid, subtle depth, glassy panels, crisp typography), but with playful “AI-reconfigured daily” quirks. The entire page sits inside a centered “router viewport” frame: a rounded rectangle with a faint bezel, tiny ventilation slits along the top edge, and a soft status LED glow in the upper-right. The background outside the frame is a dark, slightly textured gradient with faint, animated network-line traces. Inside the frame, use a two-column admin layout: a slim left sidebar for navigation and a main content pane to the right. Everything is still a single page—sidebar links just scroll/anchor-jump within the same document, with smooth scrolling and an “active section” highlight.

At the top of the main pane, place a router-style header bar. Left: a faux brand name like “GKV Admin Console” (subtly derived from Geva Kipper). Center: a breadcrumb-like path (e.g., “Status / Overview”). Right: small icon buttons resembling router UI controls (Wi‑Fi, LAN, Shield, Logs), plus a “Firmware” pill showing a daily-changing “AI Build” identifier (e.g., “AI Build: 2025-12-21 • Theme Seed: 8F3A”). Directly beneath, the hero block mimics a “System Overview” status card:  
- Large title: **Geva Kipper**  
- One-sentence current work line: “Software engineer at Google, building and improving large-scale systems.”  
- Subtitle in a smaller router-help-text style: “This admin UI is re-designed every day by AI—an ever-changing firmware skin.”  
Add a row of “status tiles” in miniature (Uptime, WAN, CPU, Memory), but they’re clearly decorative and branded to portfolio context (e.g., “Uptime: Always Shipping”, “WAN: Curious”, “CPU: Ideas”, “Memory: Projects”).

The portfolio sections are presented as router settings modules: each is a “config card” that looks like a settings page excerpt, with a left-aligned icon, a bold section title, and a right-aligned toggle/indicator that is playful but non-deceptive (e.g., “Enabled”, “Monitoring”, “Public”). Use a 2x3 grid (or responsive single-column on mobile) with consistent card height, but allow one “featured” card to be slightly larger based on the day’s AI theme (a subtle nod to the ever-changing design). Each card opens an in-page “drawer” (accordion expansion) rather than navigating away: it slides down like a router’s advanced settings panel, revealing description, links, and embedded media. The expanded drawer has tab-like subnavigation (“Overview”, “Links”, “Media”, “Notes”) to amplify the admin-console feel—still all within the same expanded area.

Cards/sections content and UI treatment:
1) **GlglStats** card: label it like a monitoring feature, e.g., “Audio Repetition Analyzer (LZ77)”. In the expanded drawer, present the project as a “Traffic Analysis” style panel with a tiny fake chart header bar. Copy: “Python project measuring repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression, plus visualizations of repetition patterns across famous tracks.” Include two prominent router-style buttons: “Open Dashboard” linking to https://glglstats.geekip.dev and “Watch PyData TLV Talk” linking to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo. Under “Media”, embed a video preview thumbnail styled like a router camera feed tile.

2) **Ahuzat Dibuk** card: style it as “Parking Occupancy Heatmap Service”. In the expanded drawer, present the scraping and visualization angle like “Scheduled Tasks + Map Output”. Copy: “Python scraping and data visualization project collecting Tel‑Aviv parking lot occupancy and generating resident-friendly heatmaps.” Provide a “News Mentions” list with two clean link rows to:  
- https://13tv.co.il/item/news/domestic/internal/parking-902956407/  
- https://www.mako.co.il/nexter-news/Article-ae43964b891bf71027.htm  
Then add a third link row labeled “Original Facebook Publication” linking to https://www.facebook.com/groups/secrettelaviv/posts/10159636301195943/. Use small “external link” glyphs like admin UIs do.

3) **2D Part Orienting** card: present it like an “Advanced Routing Algorithm” module. In the drawer, include a crisp, technical summary: “C++ implementation in an open-source computational geometry library of an efficient algorithm for constructing a push plan to orient a given polygon.” Add a single strong call-to-action button labeled “Docs + Code” linking to https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/. Visual motif: a thin-line polygon diagram in the corner, like a router topology icon.

4) **The Turing Jest** card: style it as “LLM Arena / Quality-of-Service for Puns”. In the drawer, describe it as an arena UI like “client devices competing,” with copy: “An LMSYS-like arena where LLMs compete at making and explaining puns—rated by users.” Add a bold “Launch Arena” button linking to https://jest.geekip.dev. Include a small “live scoreboard” aesthetic element (static mock) to keep the router vibe.

5) **Rhymes of Israel** card: present it like a “Browser Plugin / Content Filter (Comedy Mode)”. In the drawer: “Chrome extension using an LLM to rewrite Israeli news headlines into comedic rhymes in the style of a high-school yearbook.” Add an “Install from Chrome Web Store” button linking to https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eainginjgdkpgolpjniijdihfbeeeklb. Include a sample “Before / After” headline pair in a router-style diff box (monospace, faint grid).

6) **Portfolio Website (meta)** card: style it as “Web UI / Firmware Skin Project”. In the drawer, describe it as “A portfolio presented as a router admin console—settings pages as projects; redesigned daily by AI.” Add a “Self Link” button to https://geekip.dev. Make this card slightly self-referential with a tiny “loopback” icon and the label “localhost”.

7) **Links** card (last box): format it like a “System / Accounts” page. Inside, list three rows with platform icons and clean URLs:  
- github.com/gevak  
- linkedin.com/in/gevakip  
- facebook.com/geva.kipper  
Each row has a right-side “Open” button, matching the router button style.

Throughout the UI, use a restrained palette (deep charcoal, cool gray, off-white) with one accent color that can “shift daily” (teal → violet → amber) to reinforce the AI theme without being gimmicky. Add micro-interactions that mimic admin consoles: toggles that animate but don’t pretend to change real settings, tooltips with router-like phrasing (“Hint: This module exposes public endpoints”), subtle loading bars when expanding a card (a 300ms fake “Applying…”), and small “log line” text that appears under the header like “AI theme daemon: re-skin scheduled daily at 02:00”.

At the bottom, create a full-width “System Footer” resembling a router’s status strip. Left: a credit line in small UI text: “Generated by ChatGPT (OpenAI)”. Right: a prominent stopwatch labeled “Time since 2025-12-21 01:15:20” displaying hours:minutes:seconds, styled like a router uptime counter (monospace digits, softly glowing). Place it inside a pill-shaped panel with a tiny clock icon, and keep it visible as the user nears the end—either pinned within the footer area or revealed with a gentle slide-in when the footer enters view.
