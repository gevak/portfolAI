# VS Code Dark Theme Portfolio Design

The entire viewport mimics a Visual Studio Code window with authentic UI elements. The top bar features the classic VS Code traffic light controls (close, minimize, maximize) on the left, followed by "File Edit View" menu items, and the center displays "Geva Kipper - Portfolio.workspace" as the window title. The background is the signature VS Code dark theme (#1e1e1e) with the sidebar (#252526) visible on the left showing a collapsed file explorer icon.

Below the top bar sits a tab strip containing seven tabs styled exactly like VS Code tabs. Each tab displays a filename with appropriate syntax highlighting icons: "about.md" with a markdown icon, "glglstats.py" with a Python icon, "ahuzat_dibuk.py", "geometry.cpp" with a C++ icon, "turing_jest.tsx" with a React icon, "rhymes.js" with a JavaScript icon, and "meta.html" with an HTML icon. The currently active tab has the lighter background (#1e1e1e) while inactive tabs are darker (#2d2d2d). A subtle close button (Ã—) appears on each tab on hover.

The main content area below the tabs resembles the VS Code editor pane with line numbers running down the left margin in a muted gray (#858585). The first "tab" (about.md) displays as rendered markdown: "# Geva Kipper" as a large heading in #4ec9b0 (teal), followed by a single line in regular text stating his current work at Google. Below that, in italicized gray text (#6a9955, the comment color), appears the subtitle about the AI-redesigned website with a blinking cursor animation at the end.

Each subsequent tab, when clicked, smoothly transitions the content area to display project information formatted as code comments and markdown. For GlglStats, the content appears as a Python docstring (triple quotes in #ce9178 orange) containing the project description, followed by properly syntax-highlighted "links" styled as Python string variables: `project_url = "https://glglstats.geekip.dev"` and `presentation = "https://www.youtube.com/..."` in the orange string color. A small embedded video player appears inline, bordered with the VS Code focus blue (#007acc).

The Ahuzat Dibuk tab renders similarly with Python syntax highlighting, but includes a `news_coverage = []` list containing the three URLs as array elements. The Part Orienting tab uses C++ comment syntax (// and /* */) in green (#6a9955) for descriptions, with the URL as a #include statement in purple. The Turing Jest tab employs JSX/TSX syntax with the description in a multi-line comment and the link as a const declaration with TypeScript type annotation.

The Rhymes of Israel tab shows JavaScript code with an animated Chrome extension icon (a puzzle piece) rendered in CSS floating next to the install link, which pulses subtly. The meta tab displays self-referential HTML code with the link to geekip.dev written as an anchor tag with proper syntax highlighting - brackets in gray, attributes in #9cdcfe light blue, and the URL in orange.

The final tab uses JSON syntax to display the social links as a formatted object with keys in #9cdcfe and values in #ce9178, each clickable. At the bottom right of each content pane, VS Code's typical status bar appears in #007acc blue, showing fake line/column numbers and "UTF-8" encoding.

The bottom footer sits below the main editor area in a darker strip (#252526), left-aligned with tiny text crediting you as the AI designer, followed by a right-aligned monospace stopwatch displaying "Uptime: XXd XXh XXm XXs" since the specified timestamp, updating in real-time with JavaScript, styled in the VS Code selection color (#264f78 background with white text).

Subtle touches include the minimap scrollbar on the far right (a thin vertical strip with color-coded blocks representing content), hover effects that highlight tabs with the VS Code blue accent, and smooth fade transitions when switching between tabs. The font throughout is 'Fira Code' or 'Consolas' with ligatures enabled for an authentic code editor feel.
