# Slot Machine Portfolio Design for Geva Kipper

## Overall Concept & Layout

The page presents as a vintage-meets-neon casino floor atmosphere. The background is a deep, rich purple (#1a0a2e) with subtle animated particle effects resembling floating gold dust and occasional sparkle bursts. A soft vignette effect darkens the edges, drawing focus to the center stage.

At the very top, "GEVA KIPPER" appears in large, chrome-styled 3D lettering with a subtle rainbow reflection animation that shifts as if catching casino lights. Below it, in clean white sans-serif (Inter or Outfit font), sits the single sentence about his work at Google. Beneath that, in a smaller italic style with a gentle pulse animation, the AI-redesign subtitle appears with a small sparkle icon.

## The Slot Machine Interface

The centerpiece is a massive horizontal slot machine that spans the width of the viewport. It features an ornate golden frame with art-deco flourishes, rivets, and a curved top banner reading "PROJECT JACKPOT" in vintage carnival lettering with chasing light bulbs around the border.

The machine has three visible "windows" or reels in the traditional slot style, but instead of fruits or sevens, each reel displays project cards. The reels are set within a brushed metal housing with a subtle gradient suggesting depth and dimension.

## The Reels & Project Cards

Each project exists as a "card" on the virtual reels. When the page loads, the reels spin with a satisfying blur effect and mechanical sound-like visual wobble, then land on three random projects. Each visible card shows:

- A distinctive icon/emoji representing the project (musical notes for GlglStats, a car for Ahuzat Dibuk, geometric shapes for 2D Part Orienting, a jester hat for Turing Jest, a newspaper for Rhymes of Israel, an infinity symbol for the meta portfolio, and social icons for the links section)
- The project title in bold gold lettering
- A brief one-line description
- Glowing link buttons styled as small golden coins

The cards have a playing-card aesthetic with rounded corners, a cream/off-white face, and decorative corner flourishes. They cast soft shadows suggesting they're physical objects within the machine.

## Interaction & Animation

A large red lever sits on the right side of the machine with a spherical chrome handle. Clicking/pulling it triggers a new spin, shuffling which three projects appear. The spin animation includes: the lever pulling down with a satisfying arc, reels blurring and spinning at different speeds, a gradual deceleration with each reel stopping sequentially left-to-right with a chunky "clunk" visual bounce, and if all three matching icons land (rare), confetti bursts from the top.

Below the main viewing windows, a "PAY TABLE" styled panel shows all seven project icons in a row as small clickable thumbnails, allowing direct access without spinning.

## Project Detail Modals

Clicking any project card causes it to "pop out" of the machine and expand into a full modal. The modal maintains the playing card aesthetic but larger, with the full project description, embedded video players (for GlglStats), multiple link buttons styled as golden tokens, and news article links appearing as newspaper clipping graphics with torn edges.

## The Seventh Section - Social Links

The social links section appears as a special "BONUS ROUND" card with a different color scheme (silver and blue instead of gold). GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook icons appear as spinning coins that flip on hover to reveal the platform name.

## Footer & Credits

The footer sits below the machine on what appears to be casino carpet (deep red with subtle geometric pattern). The AI credit appears in elegant script with a small robot emoji, and the stopwatch displays in a vintage flip-clock style with individual digit cards that animate when changing, showing the elapsed time since the specified date in glowing green LED-style numerals within a black rounded rectangle.

## Color Palette

Primary: Deep purple background, gold accents, cream card faces, cherry red for the lever and accents, chrome/silver metallic highlights, and neon green for the timer display.

## Typography

Titles use a decorative serif with gold gradient fills. Body text uses clean geometric sans-serif. The timer uses a monospace digital-style font.
