A single-page, full-screen “Surfboard Skill Tree” experience: the page is a vertical ocean voyage, where the scroll position equals “distance paddled.” The background is a layered, parallax sea (deep navy to turquoise gradient) with slow, procedural wave lines and subtle foam particles drifting sideways. A surfboard (seen from above, slightly angled) is the main navigation object and stays pinned near the lower center of the viewport; as the user scrolls, the board glides upward along a winding “current path” (a faint, glowing route line) that connects a sequence of floating buoy-nodes. Each node represents a “tech unlock,” and each unlock reveals one portfolio section as a sleek card that emerges from the water with a soft rise + drip effect (minimal, elegant—no cartooniness). The site’s typographic vibe is modern editorial: a clean sans-serif for UI (e.g., Inter/Neue Haas-like) paired with a refined monospace for “unlock” labels and timestamps.

At the top, the hero is a calm horizon scene with a thin sun halo and a minimal, centered title stack. Large title: **Geva Kipper**. Beneath it, one sentence about current work at Google (e.g., placed as a single line under the name, aligned center). Under that, a subtitle ribbon: “This portfolio is re-designed daily by AI—ever-changing by design.” That subtitle sits inside a translucent “glass” pill with gentle blur, like sea-glass. A small “Daily Redesign Seed” indicator (a short hash-like string) can sit beside it to reinforce the ever-changing theme, without explaining how it works. Scrolling begins with the surfboard gently bobbing; the first “unlock buoy” appears just below the fold to invite discovery.

The “skill tree” itself is presented as a branching route: the current path sometimes forks into two nearby nodes, then reconverges, giving a genuine skill-tree feel. Each node is a buoy marker with a tiny icon (Python, C++, LLM, Chrome, Web, Data Viz) etched like a surf-wax stamp. Locked nodes are desaturated and slightly submerged; as the user approaches, the node “breathes” with a soft pulse. When a node unlocks, a short label animates in near the buoy, like: “Unlocked: Compression + Music Analytics” or “Unlocked: Scraping + Heatmaps.” The associated content card slides in from the side of the path (alternating left/right) and pins briefly while the board passes it, so the user reads each section as a stop along the ride.

Each project section is a “deck panel” card: rounded corners, matte white/very light sand background, subtle grain texture, and a thin outline that looks like surfboard fiberglass. The top edge of every card includes a small “waxed” strip holding its title, plus a “Tech Badge Line” (compact chips) and a prominent action link row. Cards are consistent in layout but visually distinguished by a muted accent color (seafoam, coral, sunset amber, deep indigo). Embedded media is treated as “porthole” windows—rounded rectangles with a slight inner shadow, like looking through water. Links are clean, underlined on hover, and always presented as clear CTAs (no hidden navigation).

The scroll-unlocked sections, in order on the main path:
1) **GlglStats** card: title + brief description emphasizing Python, LZ77 compression, Israeli pop-chart repetitiveness, and repetition-pattern visualization. Two CTAs aligned horizontally: “Visit glglstats.geekip.dev” and “Watch PyData TLV talk” (YouTube). The video appears as an embedded player preview in the card’s porthole area (or a large thumbnail that expands on click), while the project link is a primary button.
2) **Ahuzat Dibuk** card: title + description focusing on scraping, occupancy statistics for Tel-Aviv parking lots, and heat-map generation for residents. Three clearly separated news/publication links in a tidy list with source labels: 13tv, mako, and the Facebook group post. The card includes a mini heat-map visual motif as a background watermark (very faint) to suggest the project’s output.
3) **2D Part Orienting** card: title + description focusing on C++ implementation, open-source computational geometry library contribution, and “push plan” algorithm for orienting polygons. CTA: link to the TAU CGL project page. The visual motif is a minimal line-art polygon and a sequence of arrows indicating the push plan, animating subtly when the card is in focus.
4) **The Turing Jest** card: title + description as an arena where LLMs compete at making/explaining puns, rated by users (LMSYS-like). CTA: jest.geekip.dev. The card’s motif is a split-screen “duel” layout with two columns and a tiny “crowd rating” bar, kept understated.
5) **Rhymes of Israel** card: title + description of the Chrome extension that rewrites Israeli news headlines into comedic rhymes in a yearbook style using an LLM. CTA: Chrome Web Store install link. The motif is a faux “yearbook caption” strip (handwritten-like accent font used sparingly) over a clean baseline.
6) **Portfolio Website (Meta)** card: presented as an unlock called “Self-Reference.” Description notes that this very single-page surfboard skill tree is itself a project. CTA: geekip.dev (self-link). The motif is a tiny recursive frame: a miniature outline of the surfboard path inside the card.
7) **Connect / Links** card (final buoy at calmer waters near shore): a clean grid of three large icon buttons with labels for GitHub (github.com/gevak), LinkedIn (linkedin.com/in/gevakip), and Facebook (facebook.com/geva.kipper). This is styled like a “dock” the surfboard arrives at—wood texture hints but still minimal and modern. Hover states feel tactile, like pressing a rubber stamp.

Throughout the scroll, micro-interactions reinforce the “unlock” idea: when a node unlocks, a small “wax stamp” animation appears briefly near the board with the tech name (e.g., “Python,” “C++,” “LLMs,” “Web”). The header name remains accessible via a discreet top-left “Return to Horizon” button that scrolls to top, but navigation is primarily experiential rather than menu-driven. Accessibility is maintained with high contrast text, reduced-motion support (turning off parallax and heavy animations), and clear focus outlines.

The footer is a quiet, darkened waterline with a minimal credit and a live stopwatch. The credit reads: “Created by ChatGPT (OpenAI)”. Next to it (or just below, centered) is a stopwatch display labeled “Time since 2025-12-23 01:10:40:” followed by a continuously updating **HH:MM:SS** counter. The stopwatch styling matches the monospace used for unlock labels, like a clean instrument panel on the surfboard—simple, precise, and always running.
