**Visual Language & Atmosphere**
The overall aesthetic should immediately evoke a sophisticated, modern Integrated Development Environment (IDE) mixed with a kinetic typography art installation. The color palette should rely on a deep charcoal or "Midnight Blue" background (#0f111a) to reduce eye strain, accented by vibrant syntax-highlighting colors: Neon Cyan for functions, Soft Purple for keywords, and Electric Green for strings. The font must be a high-legibility monospace typeface (e.g., JetBrains Mono or Fira Code) with ligatures enabled.

The defining feature of the page is the "Ghost Writer." The background is not static; it consists of faint, low-contrast text scrolling slowly upwards—a continuous "stream of consciousness" autobiography being typed in real-time by a glowing cursor. This text serves as a texture rather than primary content. The main content floats above this layer in "Glassmorphism" style containers (frosted glass effect) that blur the scrolling text behind them, creating depth.

**Header Section**
The top of the page is dominated by a large, blinking block cursor (`█`) that leads the eye. It types out "Geva Kipper" character by character on load, followed by the static role declaration: "Software Engineer at Google." Below this, in a smaller, comment-style font (gray, italicized), the required subtitle appears: *"// This interface is re-designed daily by AI. Status: Ever-changing."*

**The 'Breakpoint' Project Grid**
The main content is arranged in a bento-box grid layout (asymmetrical grid). Each box represents a "Breakpoint" in the code where the autobiography pauses to render an output. When a user hovers over a box, the background typing stops, and the box borders glow.

*   **Box 1: GlglStats (The Visualizer)**
    Design this box with a background subtle animation of audio waveforms compressing and expanding. It features a prominent "Play" button that triggers an overlay for the PyData YouTube video. The project title is displayed as a Python function definition. A "Execute" button links to *glglstats.geekip.dev*.

*   **Box 2: Ahuzat Dibuk (The Heatmap)**
    Use a topographic map or heatmap gradient (red to blue) as the box’s subtle texture. The text should mimic a status report: "Scanning Tel-Aviv... Occupancy: 98%." Include three "source" link icons styled as news ticker items linking to Channel 13, Mako, and the Facebook group.

*   **Box 3: 2D Part Orienting (The Geometry)**
    This box should be minimalist with vector geometric wireframes rotating slowly in the corner. The title should look like a C++ include statement. The link to the project is styled as a "Compile & Run" terminal command.

*   **Box 4: The Turing Jest (The Arena)**
    Design this as a split chat-interface bubbles. On one side, a robot icon; on the other, a human. The text is presented as a dialogue log. A button labeled "Enter Arena" links to *jest.geekip.dev*.

*   **Box 5: Rhymes of Israel (The Extension)**
    Style this box to look like a glossy high school yearbook photo frame but with glitch artifacts. The headline text inside should cycle through rhyming couplets. A prominent "Add to Chrome" badge links to the store.

*   **Box 6: Portfolio Meta-Link (The Loop)**
    This box utilizes a "Droste effect" (infinite mirror). It displays a miniature screenshot of the current website inside the box, which contains a smaller screenshot, ad infinitum. Text overlay: "Recursion detected." The link guides the user back to *geekip.dev*.

*   **Box 7: Connectivity (The Socials)**
    A horizontal bar spanning the width of the grid. Instead of standard icons, use ASCII art comments or terminal command prompts: `git clone (GitHub)`, `connect (LinkedIn)`, and `ping (Facebook)`. These should hover-transform into their standard brand colors.

**Footer & Telemetry**
The footer should look like a system status bar fixed to the bottom.
On the left: *"Site Architecture Generated by Model: [Your AI Name]."*
On the right: A monospace digital stopwatch styled in warning red or amber. It displays "T-Minus" or "Time Elapsed" relative to the timestamp **2026-02-05 01:24:09**. Because this date is in the future relative to the current time, the design should handle it as a countdown to a "Singularity Event," or if the design assumes we are in the future, a count-up timer. The numbers should tick aggressively, down to the millisecond, reinforcing the real-time nature of the site.
