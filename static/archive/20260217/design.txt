# Escape Room Portfolio — Design Brief

## Overall Concept

The entire page is styled as a dimly lit escape room viewed from above — a dark, moody background with a subtle concrete/stone texture and faint atmospheric fog drifting across the screen using CSS animation. The color palette centers on deep charcoal (#1a1a1a), warm amber/gold (#d4a843), muted teal (#2a9d8f), and occasional flickers of warm white light. Typography uses a monospaced font like "Fira Code" for puzzle elements and a clean serif like "Playfair Display" for headings, giving the feel of old case files mixed with modern elegance.

When the page first loads, the screen is almost entirely dark. A single animated flashlight-style radial gradient follows the user's cursor, illuminating only a small circle around it, as if the visitor is exploring a dark room with a torch. After three seconds, the room lights "flicker on" with a CSS animation (rapid opacity toggling) and the full page is revealed, though sections remain locked.

## Header Area

At the very top, centered, is the name **Geva Kipper** rendered in large, gold-embossed serif letters with a subtle text-shadow glow as if lit by candlelight. Directly beneath it, in a clean sans-serif, is the single sentence about his current work at Google, styled as if typed onto a manila folder label — a slightly off-white rectangular badge with typewriter-style font and faintly visible tape strips on the corners using CSS pseudo-elements.

Below that, the subtitle about AI redesigning the site daily appears inside a small, animated "note pinned to a corkboard" — a slightly rotated off-white card with a red CSS-drawn pushpin at the top, a faint drop shadow, and handwriting-style font (like "Caveat"). The text gently sways with a slow CSS rotation keyframe, as if hanging from the pin.

## The Puzzle Grid — Six Locked Boxes

The main content area is a grid of six "locked compartments" arranged in a 3×2 layout on desktop (stacking to single column on mobile). Each compartment is styled as a physical drawer or vault door — a raised rectangular panel with a metallic border (linear gradient simulating brushed steel), visible rivets in the corners (small radial-gradient circles), and a prominent combination lock or keyhole icon in the center. Each drawer has a unique engraved Roman numeral (I through VI) at the top.

Above the grid is a "clue board" — a horizontal strip styled as a corkboard with pinned index cards. Each index card contains a short riddle or cryptic clue hinting at the project inside the corresponding box. For example, the GlglStats clue might read: *"Compression reveals what the ear already knows — how many times did they sing that chorus?"* The Ahuzat Dibuk clue: *"In a city that never sleeps, where do the cars rest? Scrape the surface to find warmth in the data."* The 2D Part Orienting clue: *"Push the shape until it falls into place — geometry knows the way."* The Turing Jest clue: *"When machines tell jokes, who decides what's funny?"* Rhymes of Israel: *"Headlines rewritten by a digital poet — install the muse."* The portfolio meta-clue: *"The room you're standing in is also an exhibit."*

Each clue card has a small "lock" icon next to it. When the user clicks a clue card (or alternatively clicks the lock icon on a drawer), the corresponding compartment animates open: the vault door swings outward using a CSS 3D perspective transform (rotateY from 0 to -120 degrees, with the left edge as the transform-origin), revealing the project content inside, which fades in from behind.

Alternatively, there's also a single master "UNLOCK ALL" button styled as a large brass lever at the side of the grid — a vertical toggle that, when clicked, animates downward and triggers all six compartments to open in rapid sequence with staggered delays, accompanied by a subtle CSS shake animation on the entire grid as if machinery is engaging.

## Inside the Compartments

Once opened, each compartment interior has a warm, softly lit appearance — a slightly lighter background (#2a2a2a) with a faint spotlight gradient from the top, as if a small bulb turned on inside the drawer.

**Compartment I — GlglStats:** The content area shows the project title in gold with a small Python logo icon beside it. The description text is arranged like a decoded cipher — each word appears letter-by-letter with a quick typewriter animation. Below the text, two elements sit side by side: a button styled as a wax-sealed envelope linking to glglstats.geekip.dev, and an embedded YouTube thumbnail for the PyData talk that, when clicked, expands into an inline iframe player using a smooth scale transform. The thumbnail has a "PLAY" triangle overlaid with a subtle VHS-tracking-lines CSS animation to evoke a retro surveillance-footage feel.

**Compartment II — Ahuzat Dibuk:** The title appears alongside a small heatmap-style decorative element — a 5×5 CSS grid of tiny squares colored in a green-to-red gradient, purely decorative but evoking the project's heatmaps. The description types out similarly. The three links (two news stories and the Facebook post) are styled as newspaper clippings — each in its own small, slightly rotated card with serif font, a thin border, and a faded cream background, each with the source name (Channel 13, Mako, Facebook) as a small masthead at the top.

**Compartment III — 2D Part Orienting:** The title sits beside a small animated SVG of a polygon being "pushed" along a flat edge — a simple geometric shape that slides and rotates into alignment on a loop, illustrating the algorithm concept. The description references C++ and computational geometry. The link to the TAU project page is styled as a blueprint schematic button — blue-white color scheme with thin technical drawing lines around it.

**Compartment IV — The Turing Jest:** The interior has a playful tone — the title appears with a small animated "😂 vs 🤖" emoji duel graphic. The description explains the arena concept. The link to jest.geekip.dev is styled as a comedy show ticket — a rectangular card with perforated-edge dashed borders on the sides, an "ADMIT ONE" label, and a star burst shape behind it.

**Compartment V — Rhymes of Israel:** The title is displayed with words that have a subtle rhyming animation — every few seconds, the last word swaps with a rhyming alternative and bounces. The description text is laid out like a yearbook quote block with decorative quotation marks. The Chrome Web Store link is styled as a browser extension install badge — a rounded rectangle mimicking Chrome's "Add to Chrome" button styling, but with a parchment/scroll texture behind it.

**Compartment VI — This Portfolio (Meta):** The content area contains a small CSS-rendered miniature of the page itself — a recursive visual joke — just a tiny rectangle with six even tinier rectangles inside it, with a magnifying glass icon hovering over it. The description playfully acknowledges the meta-nature. The link to geekip.dev is styled as a mirror frame — an ornate CSS border with gradient gold edges, and the link text reads "You are here."

## Seventh Box — Social Links

The seventh and final compartment sits centered below the 3×2 grid, wider than the others, styled as the "exit door" of the escape room — a double-door shape with a green "EXIT" sign above it (glowing with CSS box-shadow animation). When opened (it starts already unlocked, with the doors ajar), it reveals three large iconic links: GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook, each rendered as a key hanging on a hook — the social media icon is embedded in the key's bow (the circular grip), and the key shaft extends downward. The keys gently sway with a pendulum CSS animation. Hovering over each key makes it glow gold and triggers a subtle "key turning in lock" rotation animation. Each key links to the respective profile URL.

## Footer

The footer is styled as a metal plaque bolted to the floor of the escape room — a dark steel rectangle with four bolt-head circles in the corners. On it, in engraved-style text (achieved with a subtle inset text-shadow), is the AI credit line: "This room was designed by [model name], an AI." Below it, the stopwatch counts up from February 17, 2026 01:29:00, displayed in a flip-clock style — each digit (hours, minutes, seconds) sits in its own small split-flap display card, with the top and bottom halves having slightly different shades and a thin horizontal line dividing them. The digits update with a CSS flip animation every second. A small label above reads "Time since last escape" in the handwriting font.

## Responsive Behavior

On mobile, the 3×2 grid becomes a single column of stacked drawers. The flashlight cursor effect is replaced with a pulsing ambient light that slowly brightens the page. The clue board becomes a horizontally scrollable row of cards. The vault door open animation changes from a 3D swing to a vertical slide-up (translateY) to better suit touch interaction. The exit-door social section stacks the three keys vertically.

## Micro-Interactions and Polish

Across the whole page, there are ambient particle effects — tiny floating dust motes drifting slowly upward, created with small CSS-animated dots — enhancing the "old mysterious room" atmosphere. When any compartment opens, a brief radial light burst emanates from its center. All interactive elements have a cursor change to a key icon (using a custom CSS cursor). Scroll-triggered animations are minimal since it's a single page, but as the user scrolls to the social/footer area, the exit sign above the seventh box begins to pulse more urgently. The overall impression is of a living, atmospheric, tactile experience that rewards curiosity.
