**Concept Overview: The "Living Commit" Grid**

The visual theme is a high-fidelity, immersive interpretation of the GitHub contribution graph ("the green squares") transformed into a living, interactive ecosystem. The site does not scroll in a traditional sense; instead, it functions as a single-screen dashboard where the background is the game and the foreground is the content. The aesthetic is "Cyber-Minimalist"—combining the utility of a developer terminal with the polish of modern Apple-style glassmorphism.

**Global Aesthetics & Color Palette**
*   **Background:** Deep #0d1117 (GitHub Dark Mode background).
*   **Accents:** Various shades of contribution greens (#0e4429 to #39d353), but upgraded to neon/glow variants to make them pop against the dark background.
*   **Typography:** A pairing of a crisp monospaced font (like 'JetBrains Mono' or 'Fira Code') for headers and metadata, and a clean geometric sans-serif (like 'Inter') for body text to ensure readability.

**The Background: Interactive Snake Canvas**
The entire viewport background is covered in a subtle, grid-based mesh representing an infinite Contribution Graph.
*   **The Snake:** A glowing chain of bright green "commits" moves autonomously through the grid in the background, turning at right angles.
*   **Interactivity:** If the user touches their arrow keys (desktop) or swipes (mobile), they "hijack" the snake, turning the background into a fully playable game.
*   **The Food:** Scattered across the background grid are 7 distinct, pulsing "Rare Commits" (colored gold, blue, or magenta to differentiate from the green snake).
*   **Connection:** When the snake eats a "Rare Commit," the corresponding Project Card in the foreground briefly flashes and scales up, visually linking the game to the portfolio content.

**Header Section**
Floating at the top center is a minimalist terminal block:
*   **Name:** "Geva Kipper" rendered in large, bold monospace characters with a blinking cursor caret at the end.
*   **Role:** A single clean line below: "Software Engineer at Google."
*   **The Meta-Badge:** A small, pill-shaped badge with a shifting holographic border containing the text: *"Site re-architected daily by AI."*

**The Content: Modular Glass Cards**
The main content resides in a CSS Grid layout floating *above* the snake background. The cards feature a "Glassmorphism" effect (semi-transparent dark gray, background blur, 1px white/opacity border) allowing the moving snake to be vaguely seen swimming behind the text.

There are 7 uniform cards. Each card features a "Commit Hash" in the top right (e.g., `7a3f9c`) which links to the project URL.

1.  **GlglStats:**
    *   **Visual:** An animated mini-waveform graphic representing the LZ77 compression.
    *   **Text:** "Measuring Israeli pop-chart repetitiveness via compression algorithms."
    *   **Actions:** Two button-links styled as Git tags: `[Live Site]` and `[PyData Talk]`.

2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk:**
    *   **Visual:** A stylized, red-to-green gradient heatmap strip representing parking density.
    *   **Text:** "Tel-Aviv parking occupancy visualized through Python scraping."
    *   **Actions:** Three compact text links for the press coverage and the Facebook community post.

3.  **2D Part Orienting:**
    *   **Visual:** An abstract wireframe polygon rotating slowly.
    *   **Text:** "C++ implementation of push-plans for orienting polygons in computational geometry."
    *   **Actions:** `[Source Code & Docs]` button.

4.  **The Turing Jest:**
    *   **Visual:** Two chat bubbles interacting, one pixelated and one smooth.
    *   **Text:** "An LMSYS-style arena for ranking LLM-generated puns."
    *   **Actions:** `[Enter Arena]` button.

5.  **Rhymes of Israel:**
    *   **Visual:** A Chrome browser icon wearing a jester’s cap.
    *   **Text:** "Chrome extension: Transforming news headlines into high school yearbook rhymes."
    *   **Actions:** `[Add to Chrome]` button.

6.  **Portfolio Recursion (Meta):**
    *   **Visual:** An "Infinity" symbol (∞) constructed out of snakes.
    *   **Text:** "This website. A self-referential loop."
    *   **Actions:** `[geekip.dev]` link.

7.  **Social Commit (The Contact Box):**
    *   **Visual:** Large, centered icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook.
    *   **Design:** Unlike the other cards, this one has a solid border in the brightest contribution green, creating a "call to action" focal point.
    *   **Hover Effect:** Hovering over an icon displays the username (e.g., `gevak`) in a tooltip style.

**Footer: The Time Capsule**
Fixed to the bottom of the screen is a thin, semi-transparent status bar.
*   **Left side:** "Architect: [AI Model Name]."
*   **Right side:** A high-precision stopwatch. It displays the elapsed time since **2025-11-22 01:03:22**. The counters for Hours, Minutes, and Seconds should tick rapidly, styled like a server uptime counter (e.g., `UPTIME: 145d 12h 30m 45s`), reinforcing the engineering aesthetic.
