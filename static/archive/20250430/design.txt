# Endless Runner Portfolio Design Concept

## Core Theme
An endless runner game that parallels a software engineer's journey through tech challenges. As users scroll down, a character (representing Geva Kipper) automatically runs through a tech-themed landscape, jumping over and dodging obstacles that represent coding challenges and bugs.

## Header
- Minimalist header with "Geva Kipper" in large, modern font
- Subtitle: "Software Engineer at Google, creating intelligent solutions for cloud infrastructure"
- Small animated indicator showing "This website is re-designed daily by AI and is ever-changing"
- The runner character stands ready at the starting line

## Scrolling Mechanics
- As the user scrolls down, the runner character begins moving through a horizontally scrolling landscape
- The background displays a gradient representing dawn-to-dusk of a coding day
- Parallax scrolling creates depth with distant cityscape of tech company logos
- Code snippets occasionally float by in the background

## Project Sections
Each project is represented as a distinct "level" in the game:

1. **GlglStats Level**
   - Visual theme: Music-based environment with waveforms as platforms
   - Obstacles: Musical notes and compression algorithm symbols
   - Interactive element: Clicking reveals a modal with project details
   - Project showcase box floats above the runner with links to the site and YouTube video
   - Python code snippets appear in the background

2. **Ahuzat Dibuk Level**
   - Visual theme: City parking lot map with heat-map coloring
   - Obstacles: Cars and parking meters
   - Data visualization elements animate as the runner passes
   - News articles appear as "newspaper" collectibles
   - Links float as signposts in the environment

3. **2D Part Orienting Level**
   - Visual theme: Geometric landscape with polygons
   - Obstacles: Rotating polygons that the character must navigate around
   - C++ code fragments appear as platforms
   - Computational geometry illustrations animate in the background
   - Link appears as a 3D rotating polygon

4. **Portfolio Website Level (Meta)**
   - Visual theme: Recursive portal showing smaller versions of the same runner
   - Obstacles: Browser windows and UI elements
   - Self-referential animations create an Inception-like effect
   - A miniature version of the entire website appears as the character runs

5. **Contact Level**
   - Visual theme: Social media platform landscape
   - The runner collects GitHub, LinkedIn and Facebook icons
   - Each icon expands when clicked to reveal the actual link
   - Simple animations for each platform's characteristic features

## Footer
- The runner reaches a finish line
- Character celebrates with a victory animation
- Credit line: "Website designed by [AI Model Name]"
- Elegant stopwatch in retro digital style showing time elapsed since 2025-04-30 01:05:25
- Option to restart the runner from the beginning

## Technical Highlights
- Responsive design adjusts the runner's path for different screen sizes
- Subtle particle effects for runner's speed and jumps
- Smooth transitions between project "levels"
- Light/dark mode toggle represented as day/night cycle in the game
- Minimal UI that doesn't distract from the content, but enhances the experience

## Interactive Elements
- Keyboard controls allow manual runner jumps (optional)
- Hovering over projects pauses the runner and expands project details
- Easter eggs hidden throughout the runner's journey (e.g., clicking certain elements reveals fun animations)
