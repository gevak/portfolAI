# Data Visualization Dashboard Portfolio Design: Geva Kipper

## Overall Concept
A single-page portfolio styled as an interactive data visualization dashboard that displays skill progression over time. The site features a dark mode interface with vibrant data visualizations that animate on scroll.

## Header Section
- Large, bold display of "GEVA KIPPER" that animates into view
- Subtitle in a monospaced font: "Software Engineer @ Google - Building scalable systems for cloud infrastructure"
- Dynamic subtitle that updates daily: "This portfolio is redesigned daily by AI - Today's version: [current date]"
- A small animated visualization showing the website's evolution (circular nodes connected with lines, representing design iterations)

## Main Dashboard
The central feature is an interactive timeline visualization spanning the width of the page, showing skill progression over years. Skills are color-coded bubbles that grow in size as proficiency increases. Hovering reveals detailed skill information.

## Project Sections
Four equal-sized cards arranged in a 2x2 grid that expand on hover with a subtle parallax effect. Each card has:
- A background gradient that subtly pulses
- A circular progress indicator showing project completion (all at 100%)
- Interactive data points that reveal project metrics when hovered

### Card 1: GlglStats
- Miniature waveform visualization that responds to mouse movement
- Animated compression algorithm visualization showing LZ77 in action
- Link buttons to the live site and conference video with hover effects
- Small audio wave animation suggesting music analysis

### Card 2: Ahuzat Dibuk
- Miniature heat map that shifts colors based on mouse position
- Animated parking icons that fill up to show occupancy rates
- News coverage logos that expand on hover
- Link buttons to news articles and original Facebook post

### Card 3: Meta Portfolio
- Self-referential infinite mirror effect with nested portfolio thumbnails
- Rotating 3D cube showing different versions of the portfolio
- "You are here" indicator with pulsing dot
- Recursion visualization that zooms in continually

### Card 4: Social Links
- 3D rotating icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook
- Connection lines that draw between the icons when hovered
- Animated commit history visualization for GitHub
- Network graph for LinkedIn connections

## Footer
- Elegant timestamp display showing time elapsed since March 31, 2025, 23:31:23
- Continuously running stopwatch with smooth second transitions
- Credit line: "Designed by [Your AI Model Name]" with a subtle typing animation
- Small terminal window that shows "generating portfolio..." with a blinking cursor

## Interactive Elements
- Mouse trails leave temporary data points on the screen
- Scroll-triggered animations reveal content as user navigates
- Background pattern of subtle code snippets that occasionally "compile" with success indicators
- Light/dark mode toggle that animates a day/night cycle across the dashboard

## Technical Details
- Smooth transitions between all interactive elements (300ms ease-in-out)
- Responsive design that reconfigures the dashboard for mobile viewing
- Subtle grid lines in the background reminiscent of plotting paper
- Loading state shows a circular progress indicator with skill categories appearing one by one
