# Bug Hunter Portfolio - Design Description

## Overall Concept
The website is designed as a "bug hunting" game where visitors are encouraged to find and click on intentional "bugs" or glitches scattered throughout the page. Each discovered bug reveals an achievement or interesting fact about Geva Kipper's career. The design uses a terminal/IDE aesthetic with a dark background and bright, neon accent colors.

## Header
At the top of the page, "GEVA KIPPER" appears in large, glitchy text that occasionally scrambles and reconstructs itself. Below it, a single sentence mentions his current work at Google in a terminal-style font. A blinking cursor follows the text.

Under this, a subtitle in smaller text explains that the website is redesigned daily by AI and is ever-changing, with subtle animation making it look like it's being typed in real-time.

## Navigation
A console-like command line sits below the header where visitors can type commands like "help", "projects", or "contact" to navigate, though scrolling works too. The command line shows a blinking cursor and has auto-complete functionality.

## Main Content Area
The page is designed to look like a debugging environment with line numbers along the left side and syntax highlighting throughout. Small animated bugs (beetles, spiders) occasionally crawl across the screen - these are clickable elements that reveal Easter eggs when caught.

## Project Sections
Each of the four content boxes appears as a "code block" with collapsible sections:

1. **GlglStats Project**: Appears as a function called `analyzeRepetition()` with parameters. When expanded, it shows project details with animated sound wave visualizations. Links to the site and video are styled as commented code URLs.

2. **Ahuzat Dibuk Project**: Displayed as a class called `ParkingAnalyzer` with methods. Features miniature heat-map animations. News links appear as console.log() statements.

3. **Portfolio Meta-Project**: Shown as a recursive function with self-referential code comments. The design includes a miniature infinite mirror effect when hovered.

4. **Social Links**: Styled as an array of objects containing contact information, with icons that glow on hover.

## Interactive Elements
- Random "syntax errors" highlight occasionally, and clicking them reveals personal achievements
- A "debug console" at the bottom shows visitor interactions as event logs
- Typing certain "cheat codes" triggers special animations 
- Code sections "execute" with typing animations when scrolled into view

## Footer
The bottom contains a terminal-style signature crediting the AI model, alongside a digital stopwatch showing time elapsed since March 31, 2025, styled as a process uptime counter.

## Responsive Design
On mobile devices, the layout transforms into a terminal window with a scrollable output, maintaining the bug-hunting theme with touch-friendly targets.

## Animations
Subtle matrix-like falling code appears in the background at low opacity. When bugs are clicked, they trigger "debugging successful" animations with particle effects.
