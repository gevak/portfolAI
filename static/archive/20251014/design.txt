# Satellite Zoom Portfolio Design

The website opens with a full-screen view of Earth from space, showing a realistic satellite perspective with subtle cloud formations and city lights visible on the night side. The globe slowly rotates, creating a sense of being in orbit. At the top of the screen, "GEVA KIPPER" appears in clean, modern sans-serif typography with a subtle glow effect, followed by a single line beneath: "Building AI-powered experiences at Google." Below that, in smaller, italicized text with reduced opacity: "This portfolio redesigns itself daily through AI—you're viewing today's interpretation."

As the user scrolls down, the camera begins a dramatic zoom animation toward Earth, accelerating through the atmosphere. The background transitions from the darkness of space to a satellite map view, using actual map tiles (similar to Google Maps satellite imagery). Six glowing location pins appear scattered across the globe—positioned over Israel (for GlglStats and Ahuzat Dibuk), Tel Aviv University (for 2D Part Orienting), and three additional locations representing the global nature of the other projects.

Each project section is triggered as the camera zooms and pans to that specific location pin. When a pin comes into focus, the satellite view zooms smoothly to street-level detail, and a frosted glass card slides in from the side, overlaying the map. The card features the project name in bold, a concise description, and the associated links styled as subtle buttons with icons (video icon for YouTube, news icon for articles, code icon for GitHub repos, link icon for live sites).

**GlglStats** appears first as the camera descends over Israel, with the card showing musical waveform patterns as a decorative background element. The YouTube thumbnail is embedded as a preview image, clickable to open the video.

**Ahuzat Dibuk** maintains the Tel Aviv location, with the card featuring a subtle heat-map visualization in the background. The three news links are presented as small article preview cards within the main project card.

**2D Part Orienting** zooms to Tel Aviv University's campus, clearly visible in the satellite view. The card includes geometric line-art illustrations of polygons being oriented, reflecting the computational geometry nature of the project.

**The Turing Jest** pans to a new location, with the card featuring a split-screen design showing two "versus" sections, mimicking the arena concept. Subtle comedy masks or jest icons decorate the corners.

**Rhymes of Israel** returns to Israel with a card that displays animated Hebrew text morphing into rhyming versions, creating a playful, dynamic effect.

**Portfolio Website (Meta)** zooms out slightly to show the full geographic spread of all pins connected by glowing lines, emphasizing the global nature of the work. The card has a recursive, infinity-mirror effect around its border.

After the final project, the camera zooms out rapidly back to the orbital view. At this altitude, a seventh pin appears, labeled "Connect," which when the user scrolls to it, expands into a floating panel with three icons: the GitHub octocat, LinkedIn's logo, and Facebook's icon, each linking to the respective profiles with smooth hover effects that make them gently pulse.

At the very bottom, against the space background, small text appears in a monospace font: "Designed by Claude (Anthropic) on [current date]" followed by a live-updating stopwatch showing the elapsed time since October 14, 2025, 01:03:48, formatted as "Time since last rebuild: XXh XXm XXs" with the numbers animating in a digital clock style.

The entire experience uses smooth parallax scrolling, with the map imagery loading progressively as the user navigates. Constellation patterns subtly connect the project locations with thin, glowing lines that pulse gently. The color scheme uses deep space blues and blacks, contrasted with bright cyan/white for text and warm orange/yellow for interactive elements and pins, creating a high-tech, satellite-command-center aesthetic.
