# Library Card Catalog Portfolio Design

The viewport opens to a rich, warm mahogany wood texture background with subtle grain patterns and aged patina. At the top center, an ornate brass nameplate is mounted with engraved text reading "GEVA KIPPER" in elegant serif typography, with a smaller brass plaque beneath stating "Building infrastructure for the next generation of AI at Google." Below this, a delicate parchment-style banner unfurls with italic script: "This catalog is re-curated daily by artificial intelligence – return tomorrow for a different arrangement."

The main interface consists of a vintage card catalog cabinet viewed from a slight three-quarter angle, giving it dimensional depth. The cabinet features six wooden drawers arranged in a 2x3 grid, each with a brass label holder and pull handle. Each drawer is slightly ajar, revealing the edge of index cards within. When hovering over a drawer, it smoothly slides open further with a subtle wooden scraping sound effect (optional), and the card inside tilts forward to become fully readable.

**Drawer 1 (Top Left) - "GLGLSTATS"**: The card has a manila cream color with a typewritten aesthetic. The project title appears in bold capitals at the top with a Dewey Decimal-style classification number "004.67 GLG". The description text uses a monospace typewriter font. A red "MEDIA AVAILABLE" stamp appears diagonally in the corner. Two small brass buttons are embedded in the card – one labeled "VIEW PROJECT" linking to the site, another labeled "CONFERENCE PRESENTATION" linking to the YouTube video.

**Drawer 2 (Top Right) - "AHUZAT DIBUK"**: This card features a light blue tone, characteristic of archival reference cards. The classification reads "711.73 AHU". A small illustrated stamp of a car icon appears in the top corner. Three brass newspaper icons serve as links, labeled "Ch. 13 Coverage," "Mako Article," and "Original Publication," with tiny embossed headlines beneath each.

**Drawer 3 (Middle Left) - "2D PART ORIENTING"**: A pale green technical card with "516.08 ORI" classification. A faint blueprint-style diagram of a polygon is watermarked in the background. A single embossed button reads "RESEARCH & CODE" with small geometric shapes decorating the corners.

**Drawer 4 (Middle Right) - "THE TURING JEST"**: A cheerful yellow card with comedy/tragedy mask watermarks. Classification: "808.7 TUR". The card has a punny rubber stamp reading "HUMOR VERIFIED" with a small laugh emoji. A prominent brass link button is labeled "ENTER THE ARENA".

**Drawer 5 (Bottom Left) - "RHYMES OF ISRAEL"**: A lavender card with decorative Hebrew-style corner flourishes. Classification: "006.35 RHY". A small Chrome browser icon is embossed at the top. The install button appears as a browser extension badge with "ADD TO CHROME" text.

**Drawer 6 (Bottom Right) - "META-PORTFOLIO"**: A mirror-finish metallic card that reflects the viewer. Classification: "∞∞∞.∞∞ REC" (representing recursion). The card has an Escher-like infinite loop illustration subtly worked into the background. A brass ouroboros (snake eating its tail) serves as the link button.

Below the cabinet, a small auxiliary drawer labeled "CONNECTIONS" can be pulled out horizontally. When opened, it reveals three brass library date stamp devices, each when clicked acting as links: one stamped with the GitHub octocat, one with the LinkedIn logo, and one with the Facebook icon, with the respective URLs embossed beneath.

At the very bottom, on the worn wooden surface beneath the cabinet, a small brass library card pocket is mounted. A card peeks out reading: "Catalog curated by Claude (Anthropic AI) | " followed by a working analog-style flip-clock display showing elapsed time since November 2nd, 2025, 01:10:52 in the format "XXh XXm XXs in circulation" with the numbers rendered as brass mechanical counter digits that increment in real-time.

The entire design uses soft sepia-toned lighting with subtle shadows cast by the drawers, creating depth. Micro-interactions include gentle creaking animations, brass glints when hovering over metal elements, and the satisfying tactile feedback of drawer movements. The color palette remains strictly within vintage library tones: mahogany browns, brass golds, cream manila, archival blues and greens, with parchment yellows.
