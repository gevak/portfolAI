**Overall Aesthetic and Architecture**
The website utilizes a sleek, dark-mode "glassmorphism" aesthetic to simulate a premium, high-tech vending machine. The background is a deep, brushed matte charcoal, providing contrast for glowing, neon-accented elements. The site is a single, full-screen viewport with smooth, physics-based JavaScript animations (using a lightweight physics engine or CSS transitions) to simulate gravity. 

**Header Panel:**
At the top of the "machine" is a polished glass marquee. It features the name **Geva Kipper** in an elegant, bold, sans-serif illuminated font. Below the name, a clear, white sub-heading reads: "Software Engineer currently building the future at Google." 
Directly beneath this, a subtle, glowing dot-matrix or LED-style ticker displays the subtitle: *"Notice: The architecture of this interface is re-designed daily by AI. You are experiencing an ever-changing, ephemeral layout."*

**The Vending Area (Projects 1-6):**
The center of the screen is a frosted glass viewport displaying two rows of three metallic "coils". Inside each coil rests a beautifully crafted "snack package"—these are the six project boxes. Each package features a distinct, vibrant gradient color scheme and custom typography reflecting the project's nature.
When the user hovers over a snack, the glass brightens slightly, and the package tilts. When clicked, the coil spins (CSS 3D transform), and the snack drops using realistic gravity dynamics into the "Dispenser Tray" at the bottom of the screen. Upon hitting the tray, the package bursts open (scaling up via a smooth flex modal transition) to fill the center of the screen, revealing the project's detailed paragraph, embedded videos, and glowing button links. A simple "Close" button folds the expanded modal back into an empty wrapper, letting the user "buy" the next snack.

**The "Snack Packages" Details:**
1. **GlglStats:** Packaged as a vibrant, multi-colored sound-wave wrapper. Inside the modal, it presents the Python LZ77 pop-chart compression project with a sleek embedded YouTube video of the PyData TLV conference ([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo)) and a "Visit Site" link to [glglstats.geekip.dev](https://glglstats.geekip.dev).
2. **Ahuzat Dibuk:** Designed with a thermal heat-map texture on the packaging. The modal describes the Tel-Aviv parking lot scraping project and features three distinct news badge links to Channel 13 ([Link](https://13tv.co.il/item/news/domestic/internal/parking-902956407/)), Mako ([Link](https://www.mako.co.il/nexter-news/Article-ae43964b891bf71027.htm)), and the original Secret Tel-Aviv Facebook post ([Link](https://www.facebook.com/groups/secrettelaviv/posts/10159636301195943/)).
3. **2D Part Orienting:** Wrapped in a grid-paper design with sharp, intersecting geometric polygons. The modal details the C++ computational geometry push-plan algorithm and includes a link to the open-source library page ([Link](https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/)).
4. **The Turing Jest:** Packaged like a cyberpunk jester mask in neon purple and green. The modal explains the LMSYS-like LLM pun-arena and provides a link to [jest.geekip.dev](https://jest.geekip.dev).
5. **Rhymes of Israel:** Features stylized newspaper clippings tearing open to reveal modern Chrome branding. The modal describes the highschool-yearbook-style LLM headline rewriter and links directly to the Chrome Web Store extension ([Link](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eainginjgdkpgolpjniijdihfbeeeklb)).
6. **The Meta Portfolio:** Designed with a striking "Droste effect" (a picture of the packaging on the packaging) to highlight its self-referential nature. The modal humorously explains the vending-machine portfolio being viewed and links back to [geekip.dev](https://geekip.dev).

**The Control Panel Interface (Section 7):**
Mounted on the right side of the vending glass is the "Payment & Control Terminal." It contains a metallic keypad. Instead of numbers, the primary buttons are interactive icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Clicking these triggers a satisfying mechanical click animation and opens the respective links in a new tab:
* GitHub: github.com/gevak
* LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/gevakip
* Facebook: facebook.com/geva.kipper

**The Machine Base (Footer):**
Built into the dark metallic bezel at the very bottom of the page is an embedded digital LCD screen (styled with an inset shadow and glowing digital text). The text smoothly scrolls or statically displays: *"Interface generated by AI."* Next to it is a live, ticking JavaScript stopwatch displaying the format `[HH:MM:SS]` tracking the exact time elapsed since the precise timestamp: **2026-02-23 01:28:34**.
