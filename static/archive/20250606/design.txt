### Website Design: The Interactive Bookshelf

**Overall Scene & Atmosphere**

Upon loading, the user is greeted with a clean, minimalist, and spacious single-page view. The background is a soft, muted color, like a very light slate grey or an off-white, creating a calm and focused environment. The central element is a single, sleek, dark-wood floating shelf in the middle of the screen. On this shelf sit five distinct, beautifully designed books, side-by-side. The entire aesthetic is elegant, with a focus on typography, negative space, and subtle animations.

**Header Section**

Positioned at the top-center of the page, in a clean, modern sans-serif font, is the name: "Geva Kipper". Directly beneath it, in a slightly smaller and lighter font weight, is a single sentence: "Solving large-scale challenges in cloud security at Google."

Below this, a subtitle is displayed in a distinct, slightly italicized font, maybe with a very subtle, slow glowing or pulsing animation to draw attention. It reads: "This portfolio is re-designed each day by AI and is thus ever-changing." This sets a dynamic, modern tone for the entire experience.

**The Interactive Bookshelf & Books**

The five books are the core interactive element. They don't look identical; each cover is uniquely designed to visually represent the project within. When a user hovers over a book, it subtly slides forward and tilts up slightly, emitting a soft, warm glow, inviting the user to click.

Clicking a book triggers the main animation: the selected book gracefully floats to the center of the screen, enlarges, and opens to a two-page spread. The rest of the page content (the shelf, other books) fades into the background to minimize distraction. The open book becomes the new focal point. To close the book and return to the main shelf, the user can click a small, elegant 'X' styled like a silk bookmark ribbon at the top right corner of the open book, or simply click anywhere on the faded background.

**Book 1: "GlglStats"**
*   **Cover:** The cover has a minimalist design featuring a stylized audio waveform, similar to what you'd see in an audio editor, rendered in a striking accent color (e.g., electric blue) against a dark charcoal background. The title "GlglStats" is written in a clean, technical font on the spine and cover.
*   **Open View (Left Page):** A concise paragraph describes the project: "A Python project measuring the repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression, complete with visualizations of repetition patterns in famous songs."
*   **Open View (Right Page):** Two clearly defined, clickable areas. The first is a button that reads "Launch the App" with a small rocket icon, linking to the project site. The second is a button that reads "Watch the PYDATA Talk" with a play icon, linking to the YouTube video.

**Book 2: "Ahuzat Dibuk"**
*   **Cover:** The cover art is a stylized, abstract heat-map using a palette of warm oranges and reds on a cream background. The title "Ahuzat Dibuk" is embossed in a strong, sans-serif typeface.
*   **Open View (Left Page):** The description reads: "A data project that scrapes and visualizes occupancy statistics for Tel-Aviv parking lots, generating heat-maps to help residents find parking."
*   **Open View (Right Page):** Three distinct buttons, styled like news clippings or labels. They read: "As seen on Channel 13," "MAKO News Feature," and "The Original TLV Post," linking to the respective news articles and the Facebook post.

**Book 3: "2D Part Orienting"**
*   **Cover:** A highly technical and geometric design. The cover looks like a blueprint, with thin white lines on a deep navy background, illustrating various polygons and vectors. The title "2D Part Orienting" is written in a precise, monospace font.
*   **Open View (Left Page):** The description: "A C++ implementation of an efficient algorithm for constructing a 'push plan' to orient any given polygon, contributed to an open-source computational geometry library."
*   **Open View (Right Page):** A single, prominent button styled to look like a piece of code or a terminal command line. It reads: "> view_code_and_details" and links to the project page.

**Book 4: "This Portfolio"**
*   **Cover:** This book has a meta and slightly playful design. The cover is a simple, elegant grey with a wireframe diagram of the bookshelf itself faintly visible. The title is simple and self-referential: "The Story of This Site."
*   **Open View (Left Page):** The description: "A meta-project. This very portfolio is designed as an ever-evolving, AI-generated single-page application to showcase a love for creative and clean front-end design."
*   **Open View (Right Page):** A button with a subtle "infinity" loop icon that says "View The Live Site," which self-references the page.

**Book 5: "Connect"**
*   **Cover:** This book is designed to look like a classic, professional leather-bound journal or address book. The cover is a rich, dark brown or black leather texture. Instead of a text title, three minimalist, iconic symbols are elegantly embossed in gold foil on the cover and spine: the GitHub octocat, the LinkedIn 'in' logo, and the Facebook 'f' logo.
*   **Open View (Left Page):** A simple, welcoming message: "Let's connect. Find my professional and personal work, or just say hello."
*   **Open View (Right Page):** Three large, visually distinct, and easily clickable icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook, each linking to the respective profile.

**Footer Section**

At the very bottom of the page, centered and in a small, discreet font, is the credit and the stopwatch. It's a single line of text. First, the credit: "This iteration designed by ChatGPT." Immediately following it, separated by a pipe character `|`, is a live stopwatch labeled "Time since last redesign:", which actively counts up in `HH:MM:SS` from the specified date and time (2025-06-06 15:48:26), reinforcing the site's dynamic nature.
