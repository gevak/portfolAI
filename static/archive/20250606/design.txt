**Video Game Inventory Interface Design**

The website opens as a dark, sleek gaming interface reminiscent of modern RPG inventory systems. The background features a subtle animated particle field with floating geometric shapes in muted blues and purples, creating depth without distraction. A soft ambient glow emanates from behind the main content areas.

**Header Section**
At the top, "GEVA KIPPER" appears in a bold, futuristic font with a subtle neon blue glow effect, accompanied by a small animated "ONLINE" status indicator. Below this, in smaller text: "Currently optimizing distributed systems at Google." The subtitle appears in italicized, slightly transparent text: "This portfolio regenerates daily through AI - a living, evolving showcase."

**Main Inventory Grid**
The five project sections are arranged as interactive inventory slots in a 2-3 grid layout, each resembling premium game item cards. Each card has a dark background with rounded corners, subtle border glow, and hover animations that lift the card slightly with enhanced lighting effects.

**Card Design Details**
Each project card features a unique icon at the top - musical waveforms for GlglStats, parking meter symbols for Ahuzat Dibuk, geometric polygons for 2D Part Orienting, recursive squares for the portfolio project, and interlocked network nodes for the social links. Project titles appear in bright white with "rarity" indicators using colored bars (legendary gold for major projects, epic purple for others). Brief descriptions use clean, readable fonts with key metrics displayed like game stats.

**Interactive Elements**
Links are styled as glowing buttons with subtle pulsing animations. Video and external links feature small icon overlays. Social media links in the fifth card are arranged vertically with platform-specific color schemes that activate on hover.

**Footer**
The bottom contains a minimal credit line to the AI creator alongside a live stopwatch displaying elapsed time since the specified date, both in small, unobtrusive text that maintains the gaming aesthetic through a digital font treatment.
