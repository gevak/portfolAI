# Virtual File Cabinet Portfolio Design for Geva Kipper

## Overall Concept
A realistic 3D virtual file cabinet with metal drawers that appears on screen when the site loads. The cabinet drawer slides open automatically, revealing hanging folders with labeled tabs that can be dragged around. The background resembles a wooden desk surface with subtle texture and ambient office sounds playing softly.

## Header
Minimalist header with "Geva Kipper" in bold, modern sans-serif font, followed by a single elegant line: "Software Engineer at Google working on cutting-edge AI applications." 

Directly beneath, a subtle animated subtitle in a lighter font: "This portfolio redesigns itself daily using AI - what you see today will transform tomorrow."

## Main Interface
The file cabinet drawer contains four colorful hanging folders, each with a visible tab. When users hover over a folder, it gently raises up, indicating it can be dragged. When clicked/dragged, the folder opens on the desk surface, expanding into a full project display with paper documents sliding out.

## Project Folders

### Folder 1: GlglStats (Red Folder)
When opened, reveals music sheet-styled papers with animated waveform patterns. Contains project description about measuring repetitiveness of Israeli pop songs using LZ77 compression, with visual examples of compression patterns. Features two buttons designed as paperclips attaching:
- "Visit Project" link to https://glglstats.onrender.com/ 
- "Watch Presentation" link to the PyData TLV conference video

### Folder 2: Ahuzat Dibuk (Blue Folder)
Opens to display a city map of Tel-Aviv with animated heat-map overlays showing parking availability. Contains project description about collecting parking statistics for residents. Features news clippings with:
- Two news story links styled as newspaper cutouts
- Original Facebook post link styled as a social media snapshot

### Folder 3: Meta Portfolio (Green Folder)
When opened, shows a recursive design of mini-file cabinets within the folder. Contains a description of this portfolio website with an infinity mirror effect when users hover. Features a self-referencing link to https://portfolio-dor1.onrender.com/ styled as a business card.

### Folder 4: Social Links (Yellow Folder)
Opens to reveal three digital contact cards for:
- GitHub: minimalist card with code visualization
- LinkedIn: professional-styled card with network graphics
- Facebook: personal-styled card with social connection visualization

## Interactive Elements
- Folders can be dragged anywhere on the desk
- When a folder is opened, users can flip through the documents inside with page-turning animations
- Folders can be closed by clicking a small "x" paper clip on each opened folder
- Users can drag folders back to the cabinet drawer to clean up the desk

## Footer
At the bottom of the desk surface, a small engraved metal plate reads: "Designed by [AI Model Name]" with an elegant stopwatch beside it displaying hours, minutes, and seconds passed since March 30, 2025, 10:11:55 with ticking animation.

## Technical Elements
Responsive design that adapts the file cabinet metaphor to all screen sizes. On mobile, the cabinet becomes a file box that opens from the top. Subtle paper texture for all documents and smooth dragging animations using modern JavaScript. Accessibility features ensure all content is navigable via keyboard and screen readers.
