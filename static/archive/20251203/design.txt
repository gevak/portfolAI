# Spotify-Inspired Portfolio Design: "Geva Kipper's Dev Mixtape"

## Overall Aesthetic & Layout

The page uses a dark theme with a near-black background (#121212) reminiscent of Spotify's signature look. The primary accent color is a vibrant electric green (#1DB954) used sparingly for interactive elements, hover states, and key highlights. Secondary accents include soft purple (#B388FF) and coral (#FF6B6B) to differentiate project "genres." Typography combines a bold sans-serif for headers (Circular-style or Montserrat) with a clean sans-serif for body text. The entire page has subtle grain texture overlay for depth.

## Header Section

At the top, a sleek navigation bar styled like Spotify's player bar spans the width. On the left, a circular avatar placeholder with a vinyl record spinning animation on hover. The name "Geva Kipper" appears in large, bold white text beside it, followed by a muted gray subtitle: "Software Engineer @ Google, making the web a little more magical." Below this, in italicized smaller text with a subtle shimmer animation, the line: "✨ This portfolio redesigns itself daily via AI — you're viewing a unique, ever-changing creation."

## Main Content: The "Library" Grid

The six project boxes are presented as album covers in a responsive grid (3 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile). Each box is a square card with rounded corners and a subtle drop shadow that intensifies on hover.

### Project 1: "GlglStats" — The Compression Album
The card features an album cover design showing abstract sound waveforms being compressed into tighter patterns, using gradients of blue and pink. The "album title" is stylized like a music chart logo. Below the cover, two pill-shaped buttons appear: a green "Listen Live" linking to the site, and a red YouTube-style button labeled "PyData TLV Talk" linking to the video. A brief track listing description explains the LZ77-based repetitiveness analysis of Israeli pop songs.

### Project 2: "Ahuzat Dibuk" — The City Rhythms EP
This card's album art depicts a stylized aerial view of Tel Aviv with parking lots pulsing like an audio equalizer, heat-map colors (cool blues to hot reds) overlaying the cityscape. Three small media badges appear beneath the description, styled like music platform icons, linking to the 13tv, Mako news stories, and the Facebook post. The description mentions Python scraping and visualization for parking occupancy insights.

### Project 3: "2D Part Orienting" — The Geometry Sessions
Album artwork features an abstract geometric composition—polygons being pushed through mechanical orienters, rendered in minimalist black, white, and neon cyan. A C++ language tag appears as a genre label. One link styled as a "liner notes" button leads to the TAU project page with additional info and code.

### Project 4: "The Turing Jest" — Comedy Collab (feat. LLMs)
A playful album cover showing robot comedians on a stage with spotlights, microphones, and laughing emoji audience members. The style is retro-poster meets vaporwave. The card includes a "Vote Now" style button linking to jest.geekip.dev, with description text about the LMSYS-style pun battle arena.

### Project 5: "Rhymes of Israel" — The Chrome Single
Album art resembles a newspaper being transformed into a yearbook page, headlines morphing into rhyming couplets with speech bubbles. A Chrome extension icon badge sits in the corner. A prominent "Add to Chrome" button in Chrome's blue links to the extension page.

### Project 6: "Portfolio Site" — The Meta Mix
This card is designed with a recursive visual—an album cover showing a smaller version of itself, creating an infinite tunnel effect. The style is playful and self-aware, with "You Are Here" marker. Description notes the AI-regenerated nature of the site. Link styled as "Play Current Version" pointing to geekip.dev.

## Social Links Section: "Follow the Artist"

A horizontal bar styled like Spotify's "About the Artist" section. Three circular icon buttons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook, each with the platform's recognizable icon. On hover, they expand slightly and show the platform name. The icons have a frosted-glass background effect.

## Footer: "Now Playing"

A fixed-bottom bar mimicking a music player interface. On the left, AI attribution text: "🎵 Today's design composed by Claude (Anthropic) — an AI collaborator." On the right, a live stopwatch display styled like a track duration counter, showing elapsed time since December 3rd, 2025 at 01:08:37 in HH:MM:SS format, ticking in real-time with a subtle pulse animation on each second change. A tiny progress bar beneath it slowly fills, as if the "song" of this portfolio's existence is playing.
