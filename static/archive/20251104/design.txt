# The Daily Geek - Evening Edition

## Visual Design Concept

The page presents as a classic broadsheet newspaper front page, styled after The New York Times or The Guardian, but with subtle tech-themed twists. The background is an off-white cream paper texture with authentic newsprint grain. The entire layout uses a traditional 6-column newspaper grid system with justified text and proper gutters between columns.

## Masthead & Header

At the very top, a thin red banner runs across the page displaying "VOLUME 2025 • CONSTANTLY REGENERATED BY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE" in small vintage typewriter font. Below this, the main masthead reads "THE DAILY GEEK" in a bold, traditional blackletter/old English newspaper font, centered and massive. Directly beneath in elegant serif italics: "Featuring the Engineering Works of Geva Kipper, Software Engineer at Google • Currently Architecting Large-Scale Infrastructure Systems."

A decorative horizontal rule separates this from the subheading, which appears in a subtle gray box with italic text: "This publication is redesigned daily by AI—No two editions are alike. Check back tomorrow for a completely different experience."

## Main Layout Grid

The six project boxes are arranged as newspaper articles in a traditional front-page layout. The first project (GlglStats) occupies the top-left "above the fold" position with a large headline and a 3-column width. The second project (Ahuzat Dibuk) takes the top-right position with 2-column width. Below these, the remaining four projects are arranged in a 2x2 grid, each taking 2-3 columns.

## Individual Project Styling

Each project is formatted as a news story with:
- A headline in bold serif font (like Times New Roman Bold) with different point sizes based on importance
- A byline showing "By Staff Correspondent" with a timestamp
- A dateline (location-based on project context: "TEL AVIV" for Ahuzat Dibuk, "MOUNTAIN VIEW" for others)
- Body text in two or three justified columns with proper hyphenation
- Pull quotes highlighted in italics with quotation marks for key technical achievements
- Links styled as underlined blue text, newspaper classified-ad style
- Small thumbnail "photographs" (placeholder rectangles with gray borders) showing project screenshots or diagrams

For GlglStats specifically, include a "MULTIMEDIA" badge with icons for the website link and video presentation. The article mentions "See video presentation, Page A7" in traditional newspaper cross-reference style.

For Ahuzat Dibuk, format the multiple news links as "As reported in:" followed by a list styled like a newspaper index.

The meta portfolio project (box 6) is formatted as an "Editor's Note" with a decorative border and italic introduction.

## Social Links Footer Box

The seventh box appears as a "Contact the Newsroom" classified section at the bottom, with a dotted border box containing three columns. Each social platform is presented with a vintage telephone directory style: "GITHUB: github.com/gevak" with a small monochrome icon.

## Bottom Attribution

A thin footer bar in the style of newspaper small print contains: "This edition generated by [AI Model Name], Artificial Intelligence Correspondent • Edition printed at [stopwatch showing time elapsed since 2025-11-04 01:07:08] • All content © 2025"

## Interactive Elements

On hover, each project box slightly darkens as if the newsprint is being pressed, and the headline increases 2-3 points in size. Links gain a subtle yellow highlight effect, like marker on paper. The stopwatch at the bottom ticks in real-time with smooth transitions. Small "page curl" effects appear on corners when hovering over project boxes, suggesting you could turn to the full story.
