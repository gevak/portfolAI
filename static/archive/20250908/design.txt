### Website Design: The "geekip.dev" AI-Generated Terminal

**Overall Concept:**

The website is a single, full-screen, interactive retro terminal interface. It boots up, presents a command prompt, and allows the user to navigate and display portfolio content by issuing commands. While it functions like a terminal, key "commands" and "files" are also clickable for a fluid user experience, blending the novelty of a command-line interface with the ease of a modern website. The aesthetic is a sophisticated take on retro computing, using a dark, elegant color palette with glowing text, subtle CRT screen effects, and smooth animations.

**1. Initial Page Load & Header Sequence**

Upon visiting the site, the screen is black. A retro-style boot sequence initiates automatically, with text rapidly printing to the screen:

```
INITIALIZING G-OS v2025.09.08...
MEMORY CHECK... 4096MB OK
LOADING KERNEL... OK
MOUNTING /dev/portfolio... OK
STARTING AI DESIGN INTERFACE... OK

Welcome.
```

An ASCII art logo of the letters "GK" briefly flashes, then fades.

The boot sequence text clears, leaving a single blinking cursor at the top left. The following text types itself out, letter by letter:

**`GevaKipper@geekip.dev:~ $`** `whoami`

The command executes automatically, printing the developer's bio:

`> Geva Kipper // Software Engineer at Google, crafting the future of large-scale data infrastructure.`

Next, a new prompt appears and another command auto-executes:

**`GevaKipper@geekip.dev:~ $`** `cat motd.txt`

This prints the "Message of the Day," which is the site's subtitle:

`> This website's design is re-generated daily by an AI. The layout, aesthetics, and user experience are ever-changing.`

Finally, the main interactive prompt appears, awaiting user input:

**`GevaKipper@geekip.dev:~ $`** `_` (blinking cursor)

To guide the user, a small, semi-transparent box in the top-right corner lists available commands: `help`, `ls`, `cat [project_name]`, `socials`, `clear`.

**2. The Project Sections: Navigating the File System**

The six project "boxes" are presented as files within a `projects` directory. The user can either type `ls projects` or click a pre-suggested, clickable `projects` link near the prompt.

Upon execution, the terminal prints a list styled like a Unix `ls -l` command. Each project name is a different color (e.g., cyan) and is a clickable link.

```
GevaKipper@geekip.dev:~$ ls projects
total 6
-rwxr-xr-- 1 geva staff 4.2K GlglStats
-rwxr-xr-- 1 geva staff 8.1K Ahuzat_Dibuk
-rwxr-xr-- 1 geva staff 1.5K 2D_Part_Orienting
-rwxr-xr-- 1 geva staff 9.9K The_Turing_Jest
-rwxr-xr-- 1 geva staff 3.8K Rhymes_of_Israel
-rwxr-xr-- 1 geva staff 1.0K This_Very_Website
```

To view a project, the user can either type `cat projects/GlglStats` or simply click on the "GlglStats" filename.

---

**3. Displaying Project Details**

When a project is selected, its content is printed below the command, formatted with ASCII separators and clear headings. All external links are rendered in a bright, contrasting color and underlined on hover, opening in a new tab when clicked.

**Example Display for `cat projects/GlglStats`:**

```
GevaKipper@geekip.dev:~$ cat projects/GlglStats

==================================================
== PROJECT: GlglStats                           ==
==================================================

A Python project measuring the repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs
based on LZ77 compression. It also generates visualizations of repetition
patterns in a selection of famous songs.

GevaKipper@geekip.dev:~$ _
```
This format is repeated for all six projects, with their respective titles, descriptions, and links. The `This_Very_Website` project's description will be a meta-commentary: "You are here. This terminal is a portfolio project in itself, designed to be both a showcase and an experience." followed by its self-referential link.

---

**4. Social Links Section**

The seventh "box" is a dedicated command. When the user types or clicks `socials`, the terminal prints:

```
GevaKipper@geekip.dev:~$ socials

Connecting to external nodes...

[GITHUB]   > github.com/gevak
[LINKEDIN] > linkedin.com/in/gevakip
[FACEBOOK] > facebook.com/geva.kipper

GevaKipper@geekip.dev:~$ _
```
Each entry is clickable, leading to the respective profile.

**5. Visual Design and Aesthetics**

*   **Color Palette:** A very dark charcoal background (`#1a1a1a`), not pure black. The primary text color is a warm, glowing amber (`#FFBF00`). Clickable links and commands are a vibrant cyan (`#00FFFF`). The cursor is a solid block of the amber color, blinking at a steady pace.
*   **Typography:** A modern, legible monospaced font like 'Fira Code' or 'IBM Plex Mono' with ligatures enabled, so `=>` and `!=` look clean.
*   **CRT Effect:** The entire interface has very subtle, almost imperceptible scan lines and a slight curvature at the edges (achieved with CSS `box-shadow` and `border-radius`), mimicking a vintage cathode-ray tube monitor. Text has a soft `text-shadow` to give it a phosphorescent glow.
*   **Animation:** All text output is animated to appear as if it's being typed in real-time. The speed is fast enough not to be tedious but slow enough to be noticeable. When the `clear` command is used, the screen doesn't just empty; it fades to black before redrawing the prompt at the top.

**6. Footer: The AI Credit and Stopwatch**

Fixed to the absolute bottom of the viewport, outside the scrolling terminal area, is a single status bar. It uses the same font and color scheme.

On the left side:
`// Site design for 2025-09-08 generated by a GPT-series Large Language Model.`

On the right side:
`AI_DESIGN_SESSION_UPTIME: 000:00:15:32`

The uptime counter is a live JavaScript stopwatch actively counting hours, minutes, and seconds elapsed since `2025-09-08 01:04:58`, reinforcing the theme of a running, live system.
