Design the page as a single, scrollable “pull request” view in a minimalist code-hosting aesthetic: a white (or near-white) canvas, subtle gray dividers, thin monospace accents, and one restrained highlight color (e.g., “merge green”). The entire site reads like one open PR authored by **Geva Kipper**, with a top “PR header” bar containing his name as the title and a one-sentence status line beneath it: *“Software Engineer at Google, currently building and scaling production systems that ship to millions of users.”* Under that, add a smaller subtitle in the style of a bot comment: *“This portfolio is re-designed each day by AI—ever-changing by design.”* Keep typography crisp and modern: a clean sans-serif for primary text, a monospace for metadata (timestamps, labels like “Files changed,” “Checks,” “Approvals”). The page should feel like a merge-ready artifact: calm, technical, and a little playful.

Make the core interaction a “mergeable sections” concept: each portfolio item is a **PR diff card** that looks like a file change block. Each card has a left gutter with a faux line-number column and a tiny icon (e.g., “+” for additions) and a right content area. The sections appear as “changed files” and are collapsible like diffs: clicking the header toggles between a compact one-line summary and an expanded view. When expanded, the section reveals “added lines” styling (light green background highlights) for the main description and “comment threads” (small rounded boxes aligned to the right) for extra details or links. Include a subtle “Merge” affordance per section: a small pill button labeled **“Merge section”** that, when toggled, visually stamps the card with a faint green “MERGED” ribbon and collapses it into a tidy merged summary line—this creates a satisfying sense of progression as visitors “merge” the PR. A floating progress indicator at the top right can mimic “X of 7 sections merged” with a slim completion bar, but keep it understated.

Lay out **seven** diff cards in a vertical stack with generous whitespace, each separated by thin rules and micro-metadata (fake commit hash snippets, timestamps, or “updated today by AI”). Each card header should include: a “filename-like” title (e.g., `projects/glglstats.md`), a short one-liner, and a small chevron to collapse/expand. Inside each expanded card, structure content as two to three “diff hunks”: (1) a short description hunk, (2) a links hunk with clear call-to-action buttons styled like minimal PR links, and optionally (3) a media hunk. For the overall creative twist, make the AI-daily-redesign concept visible by subtly varying one element across the page (e.g., the accent color hue, the “commit message” text, or the PR label tags) while keeping layout stable—so it’s ever-changing but still elegant and usable.

For the six project sections plus the meta section and social section, present them as follows (each as its own mergeable diff card):  
1) **GlglStats** (`projects/glglstats.md`): describe it as a Python project measuring repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using **LZ77 compression**, plus visualization of repetition patterns across famous songs. Include two prominent links: **Site** (https://glglstats.geekip.dev) and **PyData TLV talk video** (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo). The video should appear embedded in the expanded state as a clean, borderless player framed like a “rendered markdown preview” panel.  
2) **Ahuzat Dibuk** (`projects/ahuzat-dibuk.md`): describe it as Python scraping + data visualization collecting Tel-Aviv parking lot occupancy stats and generating heat-maps. Present the three links as “external references” in a neat list with small favicon dots: (https://13tv.co.il/item/news/domestic/internal/parking-902956407/), (https://www.mako.co.il/nexter-news/Article-ae43964b891bf71027.htm), and the original Facebook post (https://www.facebook.com/groups/secrettelaviv/posts/10159636301195943/). Add a small “data pipeline” mini-diagram in the style of a code comment (Scrape → Normalize → Aggregate → Heatmap).  
3) **2D Part Orienting** (`projects/2d-part-orienting.cpp`): frame it as a C++ contribution to an open-source computational geometry library implementing an efficient algorithm for constructing a “push plan” to orient a given polygon. Link clearly to additional info and code: https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/. Style this card slightly more “code-like” with a monospace block showing a tiny pseudocode snippet-like visual (not actual code, just a stylized excerpt) to reinforce the C++/geometry vibe.  
4) **The Turing Jest** (`projects/the-turing-jest.md`): describe it as an LMSYS-like arena where LLMs compete at making and explaining puns, rated by users. Link to https://jest.geekip.dev. Make this card playful in a controlled way: include a compact “matchup” UI element inside the expanded view that resembles a PR check comparing two outputs, but keep it as a static design component.  
5) **Rhymes of Israel** (`projects/rhymes-of-israel.md`): describe it as a Chrome extension using an LLM to rewrite Israeli news headlines into comedic rhymes in a high-school yearbook style. Add a single bold install link button to the Chrome Web Store: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eainginjgdkpgolpjniijdihfbeeeklb. Consider a “before/after” diff hunk visual: left side “original headline” (neutral gray) and right side “rhymed headline” (green-added styling).  
6) **Portfolio Website (meta)** (`projects/geekip-dev.md`): present it as the very site the visitor is viewing—“a portfolio website project (how meta!)”—and include the self-reference link: https://geekip.dev. Make this card feel self-aware: include a small “CI status” row that says something like “Daily AI redesign: passing” in muted green, and a “View source” style link (even if not provided) can be omitted; keep only the self-link as requested.  
7) **Links / Social** (`links/social.md`): a clean, compact card that looks like a PR checklist with three items, each a prominent minimal button: GitHub (github.com/gevak), LinkedIn (linkedin.com/in/gevakip), Facebook (facebook.com/geva.kipper). When merged, this card collapses into a neat single line “Social links merged.”

At the bottom, design a footer that resembles the PR timeline: a final “bot comment” containing credit to the AI model that created the site (written plainly, e.g., “Created by the AI model powering today’s redesign.”) and a live **stopwatch** line styled like metadata. The stopwatch should read “Time since 2025-12-19 01:10:52:” followed by **HH:MM:SS** updating in real time, aligned like a small status badge. Keep the footer subtle—light gray background strip, thin top border, and small monospace text—so it feels like the end of a PR conversation thread rather than a traditional website footer.
