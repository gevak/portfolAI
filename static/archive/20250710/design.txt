### Portfolio Design: The Generative Subway

**Overall Concept & Initial View**

The website is a full-screen, single-page application presented as a minimalist, interactive subway map on a dark, textured charcoal background. Upon loading, animated lines dynamically draw themselves onto the screen, forming a unique, non-symmetrical subway system. This map is procedurally generated on each page load, so its layout of lines and station placements is slightly different every time a user visits, reinforcing the site's theme.

At the top of the screen, in a clean, elegant sans-serif font, is the main heading:

**Geva Kipper**
*a Software Engineer at Google building foundational AI infrastructure.*

Directly below, a smaller, subtly glowing subtitle communicates the site's unique nature:
*This portfolio is re-designed daily by AI. The layout you see is unique to today.*

**The Interactive Map**

The map consists of several colored lines, each representing a core skill set or project category. The lines are not straight; they have gentle, 45-degree and 90-degree bends, typical of a transit map.

*   **Python & Data Line (Yellow):** Connects the "GlglStats" and "Ahuzat Dibuk" stations.
*   **AI & LLM Line (Cyan):** Connects "The Turing Jest" and "Rhymes of Israel" stations.
*   **Core Computer Science Line (Red):** A single-station line for "2D Part Orienting."
*   **Web & Meta Line (Magenta):** A single-station line for "This Portfolio".

Stations are represented by clean, circular markers. Hovering over a station causes it to pulse gently with its line's color, and the station's name appears next to it in a crisp, white font. The rest of the map subtly dims to bring focus to the hovered element.

**Interaction & Content Panels**

Clicking on any station triggers a smooth, fluid animation. The map zooms and pans, centering the clicked station on the screen. Simultaneously, an information panel elegantly slides into view from the right side of the screen. This panel has a semi-transparent, blurred glass effect (a "glassmorphism" design), allowing the map to remain partially visible behind it.

Each panel is structured identically for consistency:

*   **Project Title:** Large and bold at the top.
*   **Description:** A concise paragraph explaining the project.
*   **Links:** A clean, icon-based grid of links at the bottom of the panel.

**Panel Content Breakdown:**

1.  **GlglStats Station:**
    *   **Description:** A Python project that measures the repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression and visualizes repetition patterns in famous songs.
    *   **Links:** Icons for "Visit Website", "Watch Conference Talk".

2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk Station:**
    *   **Description:** A Python scraping and data visualization project that collected statistics on Tel-Aviv parking lot occupancy, generating predictive heat-maps for residents.
    *   **Links:** Icons for "News Story (Channel 13)", "News Story (Mako)", "Original Facebook Post".

3.  **2D Part Orienting Station:**
    *   **Description:** A C++ implementation of an efficient algorithm for constructing a 'push plan' to orient a given polygon, contributed to an open-source computational geometry library.
    *   **Links:** Icon for "View Code & Details".

4.  **The Turing Jest Station:**
    *   **Description:** An LMSYS-style arena where Large Language Models compete at creating and explaining puns, with user ratings determining the "funniest" AI.
    *   **Links:** Icon for "Visit Website".

5.  **Rhymes of Israel Station:**
    *   **Description:** A Chrome extension that leverages an LLM to humorously rewrite Israeli news headlines into rhyming couplets in the style of a high-school yearbook.
    *   **Links:** Icon for "Install Extension".

6.  **This Portfolio Station:**
    *   **Description:** A meta-project: this very portfolio website. It's a single-page application designed to be ever-changing, with its layout procedurally generated daily.
    *   **Links:** Icon for "View Source".

7.  **"Junction" / Contacts Station:**
    *   This is a central, larger station where all lines intersect, styled like a major hub.
    *   **Title:** Connect
    *   **Description:** A simple call to action: "Let's connect or collaborate."
    *   **Links:** Large, clear icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook.

**Footer**

In the bottom right corner of the page, in a small, unobtrusive font, are two lines of text:

*Site design by a generative AI model.*
*Time Since Last Manual Update: [live stopwatch counting up in HH:MM:SS from 2025-07-10 01:10:22]*

The stopwatch numbers are in a monospaced font to ensure they don't jump around as they update every second, providing a final, dynamic touch to the site.
