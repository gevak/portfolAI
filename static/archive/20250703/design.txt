### Portfolio Design: The Geva Kipper AI

**Overall Concept & Feel:**
The website is presented as the direct output of a specialized AI model, "G-KI.3," which has been trained exclusively on the data, projects, and professional identity of Geva Kipper. The aesthetic is clean, futuristic, and data-driven, blending a minimalist dark theme with dynamic, AI-inspired animations. The entire page is a single, seamless scroll, suggesting a continuous stream of generated data.

**Visual Theme:**
The background is a deep, near-black charcoal (#111111). Over this, a subtle, animated grid of faint, glowing blue lines and nodes is constantly, slowly shifting and reconfiguring, like a live neural network or a star chart. This animation is non-distracting but gives the page a sense of being alive and computational. The primary accent color for text, links, and highlights is a vibrant, electric blue (#00BFFF), with secondary text in a crisp, off-white (#EAEAEA). The typography is a modern, clean sans-serif (like Inter or Manrope) for descriptions, and a monospaced font (like Fira Code or Source Code Pro) for titles and labels to evoke a coding environment.

**Page Structure & Sections:**

**Header / Introduction:**
Upon loading, the name "Geva Kipper" is typed out by an animated cursor, character by character, in the center of the screen. Once complete, the cursor vanishes. Below the name, the single sentence about his work at Google fades in softly: "Currently building the future of search at Google."

Beneath this, the subtitle appears with a subtle "glitch" effect, where it briefly flickers with digital artifacts every 10-15 seconds: *“This layout is an ephemeral design, generated today by a model trained on my work. It will regenerate tomorrow.”*

**Project Grid:**
As the user scrolls down, six distinct content boxes, or "data nodes," materialize. They don't just appear; they fade in and drift slightly into their final position on the grid, as if the AI is arranging them in real-time. The grid is a 2x3 layout on desktop, which collapses into a single column on mobile. Each box has a soft, glowing electric blue border that brightens on hover.

**Footer:**
At the very bottom of the page, the animated neural network lines converge into a single point above the footer text. The text is centered and in a smaller, off-white font.

*“This page was procedurally generated by language model G-KI.3.”*

Below this line is a live stopwatch. It’s styled to look like a digital timer from a classic sci-fi film, using a monospaced, glowing blue font.

*Current Model Uptime:*
**[HH] : [MM] : [SS]**

The timer continuously counts up from the specified date and time (July 3, 2025, 01:08:49), reinforcing the idea that this is a persistent, running process.
