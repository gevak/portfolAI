### The "Genesis Block" Portfolio Design

The website experience begins with a stark, minimalist view, embodying the "simple" state of its evolution. Upon loading, the screen is entirely black. In the top-left corner, a single, green, monospaced cursor blinks expectantly. As the user begins to type (or after a 2-second delay), the following text appears, letter by letter, as if being typed out in a retro terminal:

`Geva Kipper // Software Engineer at Google, focusing on large-scale data processing infrastructure.`

Immediately below, in a slightly smaller, static font (perhaps a muted gray), the subtitle appears:

`This site's design is regenerated daily by an AI. Each visit is a new evolution.`

A subtle, pulsing downward arrow or a simple prompt like `> scroll to evolve` is the only other element on the screen, encouraging interaction.

As the user scrolls down, the "evolution" begins. The black background transitions smoothly into a dark, textured canvas, reminiscent of carbon fiber or a subtle digital noise pattern. The rigid, monospaced font gives way to a clean, modern sans-serif. The evolution is not just a change in style but in structure. A faint, luminous grid, like a blueprint, fades into the background of the entire page, providing a sense of underlying order to the emerging complexity.

The six project boxes and the final contact box do not simply appear. As the user scrolls, each box materializes into view as a "data packet" — a shimmering, wireframe cube that rotates into place. As it locks into its position on the grid, it becomes solid, and its content loads with a series of slick, micro-animations. The box's border glows briefly with an electric cyan light before settling into a faint, persistent outline.

Each box has a consistent visual language but with unique "mutations" that reflect the project's nature:

1.  **GlglStats:** The background of this box has a subtle, animated waveform visualization running horizontally, representing the audio and data analysis nature of the project. The links for the site and video are presented as glowing, clickable nodes.
2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk:** This box incorporates a faint, animated heat-map pattern in its background, shifting between cool blues and warm reds, visually echoing the project's output. The news and Facebook links appear as press-clipping icons.
3.  **2D Part Orienting:** The border of this box is not solid but appears as a dashed, geometric outline, as if it's a CAD drawing. On hover, the lines of the border animate, sketching out different simple polygons.
4.  **The Turing Jest:** A subtle "glitch" effect periodically skews the box's title text, a nod to the unpredictable nature of LLMs. The link to the site is styled as a classic "prompt" input field.
5.  **Rhymes of Israel:** The headline text for this project uses a slightly more playful, almost handwritten-style font compared to the others. The link to the Chrome Web Store is accompanied by a stylized newspaper icon that morphs into the Chrome logo on hover.
6.  **Portfolio Website (Meta):** This box is a miniature, simplified schematic of the website itself. It contains wireframe outlines of the other boxes, with a glowing dot indicating "You Are Here." The self-referencing link is labeled simply `[source_code]`.
7.  **Contact & Links:** This final box is the most polished and "fully evolved." The background is a solid, deep black, making the social media icons (GitHub, LinkedIn, Facebook) stand out. The icons are rendered in a minimalist, neon-cyan style. On hover, they don't just change color; they emit a soft, particle-based glow and subtly lift off the page with a 3D effect.

At the very bottom of the page, the evolutionary journey concludes. The blueprint grid fades away, leaving a clean, dark footer. On the left, a single line of text in a clean, small font:

`Design generated by a GPT-4 class language model.`

On the right, the stopwatch. Labeled "Time elapsed since this design's creation:", the numbers dynamically tick upward in a monospaced font—a final, elegant callback to the simple, terminal-like origin of the site. The format is `HH:MM:SS`, providing a constant, living testament to the site's current iteration.
