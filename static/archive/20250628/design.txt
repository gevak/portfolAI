### Portfolio Design: "The Developer's Quest"

**Overall Concept:** The website is a single-page, side-scrolling mini-game. The user controls a simple, silhouetted character who runs across a minimalist landscape. The "levels" are interactive monoliths or structures that represent Geva's projects. The entire experience is fluid, with a dark, elegant aesthetic punctuated by a single vibrant accent color.

**Initial View (The "Start Screen"):**

The page loads to a full-screen view. The background is a very dark navy or charcoal gray. A single, thin, off-white line stretches across the bottom quarter of the screen, representing the ground. Standing on the far left of this line is a small, minimalist, silhouetted character with a simple, fluid idle animation.

Above the character, the name **Geva Kipper** is displayed in a large, clean, modern sans-serif font. Below his name, in a slightly smaller font, is the sentence: "A Software Engineer at Google exploring the intersection of data, algorithms, and creativity."

Directly under this, a subtitle appears in the bright, electric-blue accent color: *"This entire site is algorithmically redesigned by AI every 24 hours. What you see is today's unique iteration."*

A small, pulsating 'right arrow' icon or the text "Scroll to Begin" fades in and out at the bottom of the screen, prompting interaction.

**The Journey & Interaction:**

As the user scrolls down (or uses arrow keys), the character begins to run to the right along the ground line. The background features a subtle parallax effect with faint, abstract geometric shapes or constellations drifting slowly.

Along the path, the character encounters five distinct "level markers." These are minimalist, glowing structures. When the character reaches a marker, they stop, and the structure expands smoothly into an information card, pausing the side-scrolling. The card "floats" in the center of the screen, dimming the background slightly to bring focus. Closing the card (via an 'X' icon or clicking outside it) resumes the journey.

### The Five "Level" Designs:

**1. Level 1: GlglStats**

*   **Level Marker:** A glowing monolith shaped like a soundwave or a series of vertical bars resembling a music visualizer.
*   **Expanded Card:**
    *   **Title:** GlglStats
    *   **Description:** A Python project measuring the repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression, featuring visualizations of repetition patterns.
    *   **Links:** Two large, distinct buttons.
        *   One with a "Live Site" label and a globe icon, linking to `https://glglstats.onrender.com/`.
        *   One with a "PyData Talk" label and a video play icon, linking to the YouTube video.
    *   **Aesthetic:** The card's border and icons glow with the accent color. A faint, animated waveform graphic subtly moves in the card's background.

**2. Level 2: Ahuzat Dibuk**

*   **Level Marker:** A structure that looks like a simplified, glowing map pin or a stylized representation of a multi-story car park.
*   **Expanded Card:**
    *   **Title:** Ahuzat Dibuk
    *   **Description:** A Python scraping and data visualization project that collected parking lot occupancy in Tel-Aviv to generate heat-maps for residents.
    *   **Links:** Three buttons arranged neatly.
        *   "News: Channel 13" (with a newspaper icon), linking to the 13tv story.
        *   "News: Mako" (with a newspaper icon), linking to the Mako story.
        *   "Original Post" (with a Facebook icon), linking to the Facebook post.
    *   **Aesthetic:** The card has a subtle, blurry heat-map gradient (from cool to warm blue) as its background texture.

**3. Level 3: 2D Part Orienting**

*   **Level Marker:** A glowing, abstract, rotating polygon.
*   **Expanded Card:**
    *   **Title:** 2D Part Orienting
    *   **Description:** A C++ implementation of an efficient algorithm for constructing a 'push plan' to orient a given polygon, contributed to an open-source computational geometry library.
    *   **Links:** A single, prominent button.
        *   "View Code & Project" (with a `< >` code icon), linking to the project page.
    *   **Aesthetic:** The card's background features faint, overlapping geometric outlines and grids, evoking a technical blueprint.

**4. Level 4: The Meta-Portfolio**

*   **Level Marker:** A structure that resembles a portal or a mirror, with a silhouette of the player-character glowing within it.
*   **Expanded Card:**
    *   **Title:** This Website
    *   **Description:** You are here. This portfolio is a recursively-defined project, an interactive journey through other projects, designed to be forever-changing.
    *   **Links:** A single, intriguing button.
        *   "View This Reality's Source" (with a refresh or recursion icon), linking to `https://portfolio-dor1.onrender.com/`.
    *   **Aesthetic:** The card has a slight "glitch" effect on its border, subtly flickering.

**5. Level 5: The Hub (Final Area)**

*   **Level Marker:** The character reaches the end of the line, which terminates at a raised, glowing platform. On the platform are three distinct, smaller pedestals.
*   **Interaction:** Hovering over each pedestal causes an icon to brightly illuminate. These are not expandable cards but direct links.
    *   A pedestal with the **GitHub** icon.
    *   A pedestal with the **LinkedIn** icon.
    *   A pedestal with the **Facebook** icon.
*   **Aesthetic:** This is the "end of the level." The character stands on the platform, looking out into the parallax background, signifying the end of the journey. The three icons are the final interactive elements.

**Footer (The "Credits"):**

Below the final platform, clearly separated from the "game" world, is the footer. The text is centered and in a simple, clean font.

*Line 1:* `Design generated by ChatGPT, an OpenAI model.`

*Line 2:* A label: `Time elapsed since last system reset:`

*Line 3:* A live, ticking stopwatch in the format `HH : MM : SS`, dynamically counting up from the timestamp `2025-06-28 01:06:32`. The numbers will be large and clear.
