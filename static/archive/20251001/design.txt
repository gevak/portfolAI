# Recipe Portfolio Design: "Geva's Code Kitchen"

## Overall Theme & Layout
The website presents as an upscale recipe blog with a warm, culinary aesthetic. The background features a subtle texture resembling aged parchment or a well-used cutting board in cream and soft beige tones. The header displays "GEVA KIPPER'S CODE KITCHEN" in an elegant serif font reminiscent of vintage cookbook titles, with "Software Engineer at Google" as a subtitle in a handwritten script font below. Immediately under this, a banner with a rolling pin icon states: "Daily Special: This menu is freshly prepared each day by AI – no two visits taste the same!"

## Recipe Card Grid
The six project boxes are designed as recipe cards arranged in a Pinterest-style masonry grid. Each card has a slightly off-white background with a subtle drop shadow, mimicking physical recipe cards pinned to a board. The cards have varying heights based on content, creating an organic, collected feel.

**Card Structure:** Each recipe card features a polaroid-style "dish photo" placeholder at the top (abstract geometric patterns or code visualization aesthetics in muted colors), followed by the project name in a decorative handwritten font as the "dish name." Below this, difficulty ratings appear as "chef hats" icons (1-5 hats based on technical complexity), and "prep time" shows the tech stack icons as small ingredient badges.

## Individual Recipe Cards

**GlglStats** appears as "Repetitive Ramen" – described as a "Python reduction with LZ77 compression sauce." The card includes a small music note garnish icon and features two call-to-action buttons styled as recipe steps: "TASTE THE DISH" (link to site) and "WATCH THE CHEF'S DEMO" (YouTube link), designed as rounded buttons with fork and knife icons.

**Ahuzat Dibuk** is presented as "Parking Paella" – "A hearty scraping stew with data visualization spices." Three small newspaper icons appear as garnish, each linked to the respective news stories and Facebook post, labeled "As Featured In..."

**2D Part Orienting** becomes "Computational Geometry Soufflé" – described as "C++ base with algorithmic precision, served on an open-source platter." The card has a geometric pattern border and links styled as "VIEW RECIPE NOTES."

**The Turing Jest** is "Pun Pot-au-Feu" – "A competition reduction where LLMs simmer in wordplay until perfectly rated." The link button reads "ENTER THE KITCHEN."

**Rhymes of Israel** appears as "Headline Hummus" – "Chrome-extension spread with LLM-whipped comedy, best served fresh on Israeli news." The install button is styled as "ADD TO PANTRY."

**Portfolio Meta Project** is the "Recursive Risotto" – "A self-referential dish that contains itself. Warning: May cause existential hunger." The link button playfully states "TASTE INFINITY."

## Social Links Section
The seventh box is styled as a "Chef's Contact Card" – a horizontal strip at the bottom of the masonry grid with a knife-and-whisk crossed icon. Three circular photo-frame style buttons contain the GitHub octocat, LinkedIn logo, and Facebook icon, each with the handle underneath in small caps.

## Footer
A minimalist footer on a slightly darker parchment tone features centered text: "Today's menu crafted by [Your AI Model Name] | Kitchen open since:" followed by a live-updating digital timer showing days, hours, minutes, and seconds since October 1st, 2025, 01:08:57, styled as an old-fashioned kitchen timer display with red LED-style numbers.

## Interactive Elements
Hover effects on recipe cards cause them to slightly lift with enhanced shadows, as if being picked up. Ingredient badges (tech icons) gently pulse. The timer in the footer has a subtle ticking animation. All links have smooth color transitions from sage green to a warm terracotta orange, maintaining the culinary color palette throughout.
