# Vending Machine Portfolio — Design Specification

## Overall Concept

The entire page is a single full-screen vending machine rendered in a slightly isometric, semi-realistic style against a moody, dark urban backdrop — think a dimly lit alley or a neon-soaked street corner at night. The vending machine itself is the centerpiece: a tall, rounded-rectangle metallic body with a subtle brushed-steel gradient, rivets along the edges, and a soft ambient glow emanating from behind the glass display panel. The glass has a very faint reflection/glare effect (a diagonal semi-transparent white gradient) that shifts subtly as the user moves their mouse, giving a parallax sense of physicality. The entire color palette leans into deep navy, electric cyan, warm amber indicator lights, and pops of neon green — the aesthetic of a retro-futuristic machine that somehow runs on code.

## Top Section — Header / Machine Marquee

At the very top of the vending machine, there is a backlit marquee sign — the kind you'd see on old-fashioned vending machines or jukeboxes — with a slightly flickering neon tube effect around its border. Inside, in a bold retro-tech font (think LCD mixed with a humanist sans-serif), it reads **"GEVA KIPPER"** in large glowing letters, with a slow pulsing cyan glow behind them. Directly beneath the name, in a smaller, clean sans-serif, a single line reads: *"Software Engineer at Google, building tools that make the web faster and smarter."* Below that, separated by a thin glowing line, a subtitle in an italic, slightly muted amber/gold tone reads: *"This machine is restocked daily by AI — every visit, a fresh design."* This text has a very slow, gentle fade-in-and-out breathing animation to suggest impermanence and constant change.

## The Glass Display — Project Grid

Below the marquee is the main glass display panel of the vending machine. Behind the glass sits a grid of **product slots** arranged in a **3-column by 2-row** layout (six slots for the six projects), plus a **seventh wider slot** spanning the bottom for the social links. Each slot looks like a physical compartment in a vending machine — separated by thin metallic shelf dividers with a subtle drop shadow. Each compartment has a small spiral coil at the bottom (the kind that rotates to push a product forward in a real vending machine), rendered as a decorative SVG element in a muted silver tone.

Each project "product" is presented as a **stylized package or box** sitting on the coil. The package is a rounded card with a soft frosted-glass background, a colored accent stripe along the top edge unique to each project (different neon color per project: green, magenta, orange, cyan, yellow, white), and the following content:

- **A slot code** in the top-left corner styled like a vending machine alphanumeric label (A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3) in a bold monospace font inside a small circular badge.
- **The project name** as the main heading in a bold, clean font.
- **A one-to-two sentence description** in a smaller body font, legible and concise.
- **Small icon-style links** at the bottom of each card — represented as tiny pixel-art or line-icon buttons (a globe icon for website links, a YouTube play icon, a newspaper icon for news links, a Facebook icon, a Chrome icon, a GitHub icon, etc.), each with a tooltip on hover showing the destination.

### Slot Details:

**A1 — GlglStats:** The accent color is neon green. The package graphic is a tiny animated waveform or compression visualization (a few bars compressing and expanding in a loop). The description mentions the LZ77 compression angle and Israeli pop-chart analysis. Links include a globe icon (site link), a YouTube play-button icon (PyData talk). On hover, the spiral coil beneath this slot slowly rotates one turn, and the card nudges forward slightly as if being dispensed.

**A2 — Ahuzat Dibuk:** Accent color is warm magenta/pink. The decorative element is a tiny animated heat-map grid (a small 4x4 grid of cells that slowly shift between cool blue and hot red). Description covers parking data scraping and heat-map generation for Tel-Aviv residents. Links include a newspaper icon appearing twice (for the two news story URLs) and a Facebook icon (for the original post).

**A3 — 2D Part Orienting:** Accent color is electric orange. The decorative element is a small polygon (maybe a pentagon) that slowly rotates and then gets "pushed" into a target orientation by an animated arrow — looping every few seconds. Description covers the C++ computational geometry implementation. A single code/link icon points to the TAU project page.

**B1 — The Turing Jest:** Accent color is bright cyan. The decorative element is two small speech bubble icons that alternate popping up, with tiny "😂" and "🤖" emojis — suggesting LLMs competing at humor. Description covers the LMSYS-style pun arena. A globe icon links to the site.

**B2 — Rhymes of Israel:** Accent color is golden yellow. The decorative element is a small scrolling ticker tape (like a news chyron) with a line of fake rhyming text that loops. Description covers the Chrome extension rewriting headlines into comedic rhymes. A Chrome Web Store icon links to the install page.

**B3 — This Very Site (Portfolio):** Accent color is white/silver with a shimmer. This card has a special recursive/meta quality: the package graphic is a tiny rendering of the vending machine itself (a vending-machine-within-a-vending-machine), drawn in miniature line art with a subtle infinite-mirror glow effect. The description playfully acknowledges the meta-nature. A globe icon links to geekip.dev. The card border has a slow-cycling rainbow shimmer to distinguish it as self-referential.

## Hover & Interaction — The Dispensing Mechanic

On the right side of the vending machine (outside the glass, on the metal body), there is a **numeric keypad** rendered decoratively — a 3x4 grid of round buttons labeled 0-9, plus A and B, with embossed metallic styling and a subtle inset shadow. These buttons are not just decorative: when a user **hovers** over any project card inside the glass, the corresponding keypad buttons (e.g., A then 1 for slot A1) glow with a brief amber backlight. If the user **clicks** a project card, a delightful dispensing animation plays: the coil in that slot rotates, the card tips forward and "falls" downward with a slight physics-based tumble, and a **detail panel** slides up from the bottom of the vending machine (from behind the **dispensing flap** — a small rubber-flap graphic at the bottom of the glass area). This detail panel is a larger modal-like card that expands the project description, shows all links more prominently with full labels, and for GlglStats, embeds the YouTube video thumbnail as a clickable preview. Clicking outside or pressing a small "return" button (styled like a coin-return lever on the machine) slides the panel back down and resets the slot animation.

## Bottom Dispensing Area — Social Links

Below the six slots, the vending machine's **dispensing tray** area (the open compartment at the bottom where products fall in real machines) contains the social links section. It's styled as an open bin with a subtle inner shadow, and inside sit three "dispensed" items — small, colorful, candy-bar-shaped badges lying casually in the tray at slight random angles. Each badge is a rounded pill shape containing an icon and label: **GitHub** (gevak — with the GitHub octocat icon), **LinkedIn** (gevakip — with the LinkedIn icon), **Facebook** (geva.kipper — with the Facebook icon). These badges have a playful, already-dispensed look — slightly overlapping, with tiny shadow beneath each as if they physically sit in the tray. On hover, each badge lifts up slightly and glows.

## Bottom Machine Footer — Credits and Stopwatch

Below the dispensing tray, on the base of the vending machine body, there is a **small digital LED screen** — the kind that shows price or messages on real vending machines. It is styled with a dark recessed panel, a faint scanline effect, and a green or amber dot-matrix font. This screen displays two lines: the first is the AI credit line — *"Designed by Claude (Anthropic) — vending fresh ideas since 2025"* — and the second line is the live stopwatch counting up from **2026-02-14 01:24:35**, formatted as **"Uptime: XXXd XXh XXm XXs"**, ticking every second. The numbers update with a slight digital flicker to mimic an LED display refresh.

## Ambient Details and Polish

- **Coin slot:** On the upper right side of the machine body, a decorative coin slot with a small label that says "Insert curiosity." Purely decorative but adds charm.
- **Subtle hum:** An optional, very quiet ambient hum sound (toggleable via a small speaker icon) to simulate a vending machine compressor — just a 2-second looping low drone, off by default.
- **Background:** Behind the vending machine, the page background is a dark gradient with faint, blurred neon reflections on what appears to be wet asphalt — created with CSS gradients and a few soft radial glows in pink and blue.
- **Responsive behavior:** On mobile, the vending machine narrows and the grid becomes a single column of slots (stacked vertically), with the keypad hidden, and the dispensing interaction replaced by a simple tap-to-expand accordion. The machine still retains its metallic frame and glass panel, just in a taller, narrower "slim vending machine" form factor.
- **Typography:** The primary font is a clean geometric sans-serif (like Inter or DM Sans) for readability. The marquee uses a display font with a slight retro-tech flavor (like Orbitron or similar). The LED screen uses a monospace dot-matrix style font. Slot codes use a bold condensed monospace.
- **Scrolling:** The page ideally fits in one viewport on desktop with no scroll needed, but if content overflows, the scroll experience is smooth and the background stays fixed (the vending machine scrolls while the dark alley backdrop parallaxes subtly).
