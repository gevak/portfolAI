### Portfolio Design: The Interactive 3D Desk

**Overall Concept**

The website is a single, continuous page presenting a photorealistic, interactive 3D model of a modern, minimalist programmer's desk. The scene is rendered in a slightly stylized, clean aesthetic with soft, warm lighting from a virtual desk lamp, casting gentle shadows. The user can click and drag to orbit the desk, exploring the objects on its surface. Each key object represents a project or a set of links. Clicking an object triggers a smooth camera zoom and focus, blurring the background and bringing up an elegant, semi-transparent information card with project details and links.

**Initial View & Header**

Upon loading, the camera performs a slow, cinematic pan across the desk. At the top of the screen, the following text elegantly fades in with a soft focus effect:

**Geva Kipper**
*A Software Engineer at Google, crafting the future of developer tooling.*

Beneath this, a smaller, subtly animated subtitle appears, as if being typed out:
*This portfolio is re-imagined and re-designed by an AI each day, so its form is ever-changing.*

**The Interactive Desk and its Sections**

The desk has a clean, light wood surface with matte black metal legs. The following objects are artfully arranged on it. Hovering over an object causes it to emit a soft, white glow, and its title appears as a clean tooltip.

1.  **GlglStats:** Represented by a pair of sleek, modern, wireless headphones resting next to a small tablet displaying a vibrant audio waveform. Clicking this object zooms the camera in. The information card that appears presents the project description, a button linking to the 'GlglStats' site, and another button that opens an embedded YouTube player to display the PyData talk directly within the overlay.

2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk:** A small, detailed model of a red convertible car is parked on top of a stylized, foldable map of Tel Aviv. The map has glowing, heat-map-like orange and red patches on it. Clicking the car brings up a card with the project's description and three distinct links: two styled as "As Seen On: Channel 13" and "As Seen On: Mako," and a third styled as "The Original Post" with a Facebook icon.

3.  **2D Part Orienting:** A complex, metallic, geometric puzzle (like a disentanglement puzzle) sits on a sheet of blueprint paper that has faint geometric diagrams on it. Clicking the puzzle brings up an info card detailing the C++ project. It features a single, prominent button labeled "View The Algorithm & Code" with a small C++ logo next to it.

4.  **The Turing Jest:** A classic, bright yellow rubber chicken sits comically on the corner of the desk, looking slightly out of place but intriguing. When clicked, the info card appears with the LLM project description and a button that says "Try The Arena," linking to the project's website.

5.  **Rhymes of Israel:** A modern tablet displays a mock-up of the Chrome Web Store page for the extension. A classic, old-fashioned quill pen is resting on the screen, bridging the theme of classic rhymes and modern tech. Clicking the tablet presents the info card and a button with the Chrome logo labeled "Install the Extension."

6.  **The Portfolio Project (Meta):** A small, sleek, digital photo frame stands on the desk. Instead of a photo, it displays a live, miniature, animated version of the desk itself, creating an infinite mirror effect. Clicking the frame brings up a card that reads: "You're already here! This portfolio is a project in itself, blending 3D interactivity with AI-driven design concepts." A button links to `geekip.dev`.

7.  **Social & Professional Links:** A minimalist, black business card holder contains a fanned-out stack of three cards. The top card shows the GitHub Octocat logo, the middle shows the LinkedIn logo, and the bottom shows the Facebook logo. Clicking any of these cards directly opens the corresponding profile link in a new tab.

**Footer**

At the very bottom of the page, as a fixed 2D element separate from the 3D scene, is a clean, minimalist footer bar. It contains two lines of text in a small, elegant font:

*This interactive experience was designed and structured by a generative AI model.*

*Time since last AI re-design: [A live, running stopwatch showing HH:MM:SS, counting up from 2025-07-15 01:14:24]*
