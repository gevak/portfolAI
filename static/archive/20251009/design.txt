# API Documentation Portfolio Design

## Visual Theme & Layout

The page presents as a sleek, dark-themed API documentation interface reminiscent of Stripe or Twilio docs, with a navy-blue to black gradient background (#0a0e27 to #000000). The top header features "GEVA KIPPER API v2025" in a monospace font (JetBrains Mono), styled like an API endpoint, with a small pulsing green status indicator dot showing "ONLINE". Below the name, in smaller gray text, appears the current work sentence about Google. Immediately beneath, a subtle animated text banner in amber (#fbbf24) displays the subtitle about daily AI redesigns, with a gentle typewriter effect that completes on page load.

## Left Sidebar Navigation

A fixed left sidebar (20% width) displays a mock API table of contents styled as endpoint categories. Each section title appears as a clickable REST endpoint path: `/projects/glglstats`, `/projects/ahuzat-dibuk`, `/projects/2d-orienting`, `/projects/turing-jest`, `/projects/rhymes-israel`, `/meta/portfolio`, and `/contact/links`. Each endpoint has a colored HTTP method badge (GET in green) preceding it. Hovering over an endpoint highlights it with a subtle glow and smoothly scrolls to the corresponding section.

## Main Content Area

The main content (80% width, right side) presents each project as a collapsible API endpoint documentation block. Each section header displays as a code snippet with syntax highlighting: the HTTP method, the endpoint path, and a brief one-line description as a comment. Below each header, the content expands into a "Request Parameters" area (project description), "Response" area (links formatted as JSON objects with proper indentation and syntax coloring), and "Example Usage" (the embedded video or images where applicable).

## Project Sections Styling

GlglStats appears with a small animated waveform visualization in the corner, representing audio repetition. The YouTube video embeds inline with rounded corners and a subtle shadow. Ahuzat Dibuk features a tiny animated heatmap grid that shifts colors. The news links appear as a JSON array with newspaper emoji icons. 2D Part Orienting shows a subtle rotating polygon SVG graphic. The Turing Jest section includes animated quotation marks that occasionally swap positions. Rhymes of Israel displays a small Chrome logo that bounces when hovered. The Meta/Portfolio section contains a recursive smaller version of the page header that creates an infinite mirror effect when clicked.

## Contact Section

The final contact links section formats as a cURL command example, where each social platform appears as a command flag: `--github gevak --linkedin gevakip --facebook geva.kipper`. Each link glows with its platform's brand color on hover (purple for GitHub, blue for LinkedIn, blue for Facebook).

## Footer

At the very bottom, a dark footer bar contains centered text in a lighter gray: "Documentation generated by [Claude 3.7 Sonnet] on 2025-01-09" followed by a live-updating monospace timestamp showing "Uptime: XXh XXm XXs" since the specified date, with the numbers incrementing in real-time using a subtle flip animation for each digit change.

## Interactive Elements

All code blocks support a "Copy" button that appears on hover. Smooth scroll-spy highlights the current section in the sidebar. A subtle particle effect of binary digits (0s and 1s) occasionally drifts across the background. Response time badges (e.g., "200ms") appear next to section headers and animate when sections are clicked. The entire design uses smooth transitions and micro-interactions to feel alive and responsive, like a real API responding to requests.
