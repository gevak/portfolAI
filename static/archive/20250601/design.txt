## Matrix Resume Portfolio Design

The website opens with a full-screen black background where green digital rain cascades continuously from top to bottom, mimicking the iconic Matrix effect. As characters fall, they gradually coalesce and freeze in strategic positions to form readable text blocks containing resume information.

**Header Formation**: The developer's name "Geva Kipper" materializes first as falling characters slow down and lock into position at the top center, followed by a single line describing his current work at Google. Below this, smaller characters form the subtitle about the AI-redesigned nature of the site, creating an elegant three-tiered header that emerges from the digital chaos.

**Five Floating Panels**: Instead of traditional boxes, the content appears in five translucent dark panels that seem to float in the digital rain. Each panel has a subtle green border that pulses softly, and the Matrix characters continue falling behind them while the panel content remains clearly readable. The panels are arranged in an asymmetrical but balanced layout - two larger panels on the left (GlglStats and Ahuzat Dibuk), two medium panels on the right (2D Part Orienting and the meta portfolio project), and one smaller panel at the bottom center for social links.

**Interactive Elements**: When hovering over any panel, the falling code behind it slows down and the characters briefly highlight the panel edges. Project links appear as green highlighted text that glows when hovered, maintaining the Matrix aesthetic. The video and external links are represented by small green icons that pulse rhythmically.

**Dynamic Footer**: At the bottom, the AI credit and real-time stopwatch are integrated into the falling code stream itself - the characters periodically form these elements before dissolving back into random symbols and reforming with updated time, creating a mesmerizing loop that reinforces the "ever-changing" theme.

The overall effect is a sophisticated blend of nostalgic sci-fi aesthetics with modern minimalism, where the constant motion of falling code provides visual interest while the floating content panels ensure excellent readability and professional presentation.
