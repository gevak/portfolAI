# Recipe Cookbook Portfolio — Design Description

## Overall Concept & Atmosphere

The entire single-page site is designed to look and feel like a weathered, well-loved recipe cookbook lying open on a wooden kitchen counter. The background is a seamless, warm photo-texture of butcher-block wood grain, slightly blurred at the edges with a subtle vignette. Layered on top of that is a central "page" area — a cream/off-white parchment texture with faint coffee-ring stains, tiny splatter marks, and a barely-visible grid pattern reminiscent of a notebook. The page has a soft torn-edge effect along its left and right borders and a subtle drop shadow lifting it off the wooden counter. The overall color palette is warm: cream, burnt sienna, paprika red, olive green, saffron gold, and dark espresso brown for text.

## Typography & Decorative Elements

The primary heading font is a hand-drawn serif that looks like it was written in marker on a recipe card — something like "Playfair Display" or "Lora" for elegance with a "Caveat" or "Kalam" handwriting font used for annotations, side-notes, and the subtitle. Body text uses a clean serif like "Merriweather" at comfortable size. Scattered around the margins of the page are small, hand-drawn SVG illustrations of cooking utensils — a whisk, a wooden spoon, a knife, a pot — but on closer inspection each utensil is subtly morphed into a tech object: the whisk handle is a USB connector, the spoon bowl is a terminal cursor, the knife blade has binary digits etched into it, the pot has angle-brackets for handles. These are drawn in a single-stroke, warm brown ink style and float gently with a slow CSS parallax wobble when the user scrolls.

## Header Section

At the very top of the parchment page is a large, centered decorative banner shaped like a vintage cookbook title cartouche — an ornate border made of curling vines that, on inspection, are drawn from circuit-board traces and curly braces. Inside this cartouche, the title reads **"Chef Geva Kipper's Code Kitchen"** in the hand-drawn serif, large and proud. Directly below in the handwriting font, slightly slanted as if penciled in: **"Senior Software Engineer currently cooking up scalable systems at Google."** Below that, separated by a thin decorative divider (a line of tiny alternating fork-and-keyboard icons), is the subtitle in a smaller italic handwriting style, colored in a faded pencil-grey: *"This cookbook is re-designed each day by AI — so the menu is ever-changing. Bon appétit!"* A tiny sparkle animation plays on the word "ever-changing" — just two or three small star particles that fade in and out on a loop.

## Project Sections — The Recipe Cards

The six project sections are presented as individual **recipe cards** arranged in a two-column, three-row masonry-style grid on the parchment page. Each card is a slightly off-white rectangle with rounded corners, a very subtle rotation (alternating between -1° and +1° per card, giving a scattered-on-the-counter feel), and a pin or piece of tape at the top — rendered as a small SVG of a strip of washi tape in varying warm colors (paprika, saffron, olive, etc.) that appears to hold the card to the page. Each card has a soft box-shadow as if it's physically resting on the parchment.

Each recipe card follows this internal structure from top to bottom:

**Card header:** A "recipe name" in the hand-drawn serif font, bold, acting as the project title. Next to it, a small icon/emoji that represents the "cuisine type" (described per card below). Below the name, a single line in small caps and olive-green color reads the "cuisine category" — a playful tech-cooking genre.

**"Ingredients" section:** A short bulleted list styled to look like a handwritten ingredient list (using the handwriting font, with small checkbox squares next to each item). These list the key technologies, tools, or concepts used.

**"Cooking Instructions" section:** A paragraph in the clean serif body font describing what the project does — written in the voice of a recipe. For example, instead of dry technical language, it says things like "Fold in the compression algorithm gently until the repetition patterns rise to the surface."

**"Serving Suggestions" section:** This is where the external links live. Each link is styled as a small button that looks like a handwritten label tag — a rounded rectangle with a dashed border, the link text in the handwriting font, and a small relevant icon to its left (a globe for websites, a play-triangle for video, a newspaper for news articles, a Facebook logo for Facebook links, a puzzle piece for Chrome extensions). On hover, each tag lifts slightly (translateY and increased shadow) and the dashed border becomes solid, with a warm color fill sliding in from left to right.

**Per-card details:**

**Card 1 — "GlglStats Soufflé"** 🎵 Category: *"Algorithmic Appetizer — Python Cuisine"*. The icon is a musical note merged with a chef's hat. Ingredients: Python, LZ77 Compression, Data Visualization, Israeli Pop Charts. The description is written as a soufflé recipe — delicate, must be measured precisely — talking about compressing pop lyrics and watching how they deflate or hold their air, revealing repetitive patterns. The visualization portion is described as "plating the dish with colorful garnish showing each song's inner structure." Serving suggestions: a link to the live site (glglstats.geekip.dev) and a link to the PyData TLV conference talk YouTube video, labeled "Watch the chef present this dish live at PyData TLV."

**Card 2 — "Ahuzat Dibuk Stew"** 🚗 Category: *"Slow-Cooked Scraping — Python Cuisine"*. The icon is a parking sign shaped like a steaming pot. Ingredients: Python, Web Scraping, Heatmap Generation, Public Data. The description is a stew recipe — "let the data simmer over several weeks of scraping, stirring regularly, until a rich broth of occupancy statistics forms. Serve over a heatmap bed for hungry Tel-Aviv residents looking for parking." Serving suggestions: three links — the two news story links (Channel 13, Mako) with newspaper icons labeled with the outlet names, and the Facebook post link labeled "The original recipe was first shared in Secret Tel Aviv."

**Card 3 — "2D Part Orienting Tartare"** 📐 Category: *"Precision Plating — C++ Haute Cuisine"*. The icon is a geometric polygon on a cutting board. Ingredients: C++, CGAL Library, Computational Geometry, Push-Plan Algorithms. The description reads as a tartare recipe — raw, precise, every cut must be exact — about constructing push plans to orient a polygon, contributed to an open-source library. "This dish requires a surgeon's knife and a mathematician's eye." Serving suggestion: one link to the TAU project page for info and code.

**Card 4 — "The Turing Jest Flambé"** 🤣 Category: *"AI Tasting Menu — LLM Fusion"*. The icon is a jester hat with a flame. Ingredients: Large Language Models, Arena-style Rating, Puns, Natural Language Understanding. The description is a flambé recipe — dramatic, performative — where LLMs compete in a fiery arena to craft and explain puns, and diners (users) judge which dish burns brightest. Serving suggestion: link to jest.geekip.dev labeled "Taste-test the puns yourself."

**Card 5 — "Rhymes of Israel Garnish"** 📰 Category: *"Browser-Side Seasoning — Chrome Extension"*. The icon is a newspaper rolled into a rhyming scroll with a small chrome logo. Ingredients: Chrome Extension API, LLM Integration, Hebrew NLP, Comedy Writing. The description is a garnish/finishing-touch recipe — "sprinkle this extension over any Israeli news site and watch the headlines transform into comedic yearbook-style rhyming couplets. A dash of AI, a pinch of humor." Serving suggestion: link to the Chrome Web Store listing, labeled "Add this seasoning to your browser."

**Card 6 — "Meta Meringue (This Very Page)"** 🔄 Category: *"Recursive Dessert — HTML/CSS/JS Pâtisserie"*. The icon is an infinity symbol shaped like a meringue swirl. Ingredients: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AI-Generated Design, Self-Reference. The description is a meringue recipe — "whip the egg whites of creativity until stiff peaks form, fold in a mirror, and bake until the dessert reflects itself perfectly. You are eating it right now." A playful tone acknowledging the meta-nature. Serving suggestion: a link to geekip.dev labeled "You're already here, but click if you want to taste it again."

Each card, when hovered, rises slightly off the parchment (increased box-shadow and subtle scale to 1.02) and the washi tape at the top gets a tiny stretch animation as if the card is pulling against it.

## Socials Section — "Share This Cookbook"

Below the recipe card grid, a full-width section styled as a torn-off strip of parchment with a deckled top edge. Centered on it is the heading **"Find the Chef Online"** in the handwriting font. Below it are three circular icons arranged horizontally — GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook — each drawn in the warm ink-sketch style matching the utensil illustrations. Each circle sits inside a small illustrated plate (a simple circle with a subtle plate rim and shadow). On hover, the icon gently spins as if the plate is being turned on a lazy susan, and the ink color fills from brown to each platform's brand color (GitHub dark grey, LinkedIn blue, Facebook blue). The links point to github.com/gevak, linkedin.com/in/gevakip, and facebook.com/geva.kipper respectively, with the username displayed below each plate in small text.

## Footer — Chef's Credits & The Kitchen Timer

At the very bottom of the parchment page, a final section styled like the inside back cover of a cookbook — slightly darker cream with a faint "printed" texture. On the left side, a small paragraph in elegant italic serif reads: *"Today's edition of this cookbook was lovingly prepared by Claude (Anthropic), your AI sous-chef."* accompanied by a tiny chef's-kiss hand illustration.

On the right side, there is a **kitchen timer** — visually designed to look like a classic round mechanical kitchen timer with a circular dial. The outer ring is a warm copper/bronze color with minute markings etched around it. Inside the dial, a digital-style readout (using a monospace font that still feels warm, like "Courier Prime" or a hand-drawn monospace) displays the elapsed time since February 13, 2026, 01:45:10 UTC in the format **"XXXd HHh MMm SSs"** — days, hours, minutes, seconds — updating every second via JavaScript. The seconds cause a tiny tick animation on a small indicator arrow on the dial's rim. Below the timer, in faint handwriting: *"Time since this cookbook was first opened."*

## Animations & Interactions

When the page first loads, the recipe cards animate in with a staggered entrance — each card slides up from below and fades in with a 100ms delay between them, as if being dealt onto the table. The header cartouche fades in first with a gentle scale-up. A very subtle CSS animation makes the coffee-ring stains on the parchment background pulse in opacity extremely slowly, giving the page an almost imperceptibly alive quality. Scrolling is smooth. On mobile, the recipe cards stack into a single column, each card taking full width, and the slight rotations are removed for cleaner reading. The wooden background becomes less prominent and the parchment fills more of the viewport. All link hover effects are replaced with active/tap states.
