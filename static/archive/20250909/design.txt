### A Subway Map Portfolio Design: "The Geva Kipper Transit System"

#### **Overall Vision & On-Load Experience**

The website is a single, full-screen, interactive page with a dark, subtly textured background reminiscent of a slate wall in a modern subway station. Upon loading, the visitor sees the subway lines elegantly draw themselves across the screen as smooth, animated SVG paths. Each line is a vibrant, distinct color. Shortly after, the station markers (circles) fade into view at their designated points on the lines. The entire experience is fluid and feels alive.

The visual style is a minimalist and clean interpretation of a transit map, think of a blend between the London Underground map's clarity and a futuristic, digital interface.

#### **Header & Title**

At the top-center of the map, styled like the city's central station name on a transit map, is the developer's name in a bold, geometric sans-serif font (like Montserrat Bold):
**GEVA KIPPER**

Directly beneath it, in a slightly smaller, lighter weight font, is the single sentence:
*Currently exploring the frontiers of language and code at Google.*

Below this, a distinct, monospaced font with a subtle, continuous text-glitch or flickering animation presents the subtitle, creating a dynamic, "live" feel:
`// This site is algorithmically re-designed daily by AI. Its form is ever-changing.`

#### **The Interactive Map: Lines & Stations**

The map itself is the main content area. There are 4-5 primary "lines," each representing a core skill. For example:

*   **The Python Line (Green):** Connects Python-based projects.
*   **The C++ Line (Red):** For C++ and low-level projects.
*   **The LLM/AI Line (Blue):** Connects projects involving large language models.
*   **The Web/Front-End Line (Yellow):** For web apps and extensions.

**Stations** are represented by clean circles. Simple stops are a single colored circle. **Interchange Stations**, where a project uses multiple skills, are represented by concentric circles or a cluster of colored rings, indicating the lines that pass through them.

*   **Interaction:** Hovering over a line causes it to glow faintly and a tooltip appears with the skill name (e.g., "Python"). Hovering over a station causes it to pulse and its name label appears next to it in a clean font.

*   **Clicking a Station:** Clicking a station does not navigate away. Instead, a sleek, semi-transparent dark modal window smoothly slides in from the right side of the screen, overlaying a portion of the map. This "Information Panel" is styled like a digital transit departures board.

#### **Project & Content Sections (The Station Information Panels)**

Each modal panel has a consistent layout:

*   **Header:** The project's name in a large, clear font. Beside the name are small, colored dot icons corresponding to the "lines" (skills) involved in the project.
*   **Description:** A concise paragraph explaining the project.
*   **Links:** A dedicated section with clean, icon-based links. For example:
    *   **GlglStats:** A globe icon for the site link, a YouTube play button icon for the video link.
    *   **Ahuzat Dibuk:** Newspaper icons for news stories, a Facebook 'F' icon for the post.
    *   **2D Part Orienting:** A code (`</>`) icon for the project/code page.
    *   **The Turing Jest:** A globe icon for the site link.
    *   **Rhymes of Israel:** A puzzle piece or extension icon for the Chrome Web Store link.
    *   **Portfolio Website:** A "You Are Here" map pin icon for the self-referential link.

The final section is a special, prominent station on the map labeled **"Junction"** or **"Terminal"**. Clicking it opens a panel dedicated to social and professional links:

*   **Junction Panel:** This panel simply contains three large, clickable icons with labels: GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Hovering over each icon reveals the full username/URL.

The user can close the modal with a distinct 'X' button in the corner, which smoothly animates the panel sliding back out of view, returning them to the full map.

#### **Footer & Final Details**

At the very bottom of the page, centered and in a small, unobtrusive font, are two lines:

1.  A credit: `Design Concept by [AI Model Name]. Last iteration: [Current Date].`
2.  A live stopwatch with a digital-style font, continuously counting up from the specified time:
    `Time Since Genesis: [XXXX Hours, XX Minutes, XX Seconds]` (counting up from 2025-09-09 05:44:05).

This final element adds to the sense of a living, persistent digital artifact, reinforcing the unique theme of the portfolio.
