# Interactive Bookshelf Portfolio — Design Description

The page opens to a warm, atmospheric scene: a floor-to-ceiling wooden bookshelf rendered in rich 3D-perspective CSS, set against a dark, moody study-room backdrop with a subtle vignette. The wall behind the shelf has a faint wallpaper texture — something like dark emerald with a barely-visible damask pattern. Soft, warm point-lighting appears to emanate from a small brass reading lamp sitting on one of the shelves, casting a gentle glow and subtle CSS box-shadows across the books. Tiny animated dust motes float lazily across the scene using lightweight CSS keyframe animations.

## Header Area

Above the bookshelf, centered, the name **Geva Kipper** is displayed in a large, elegant serif font (like "Playfair Display" or "Cormorant Garamond") with a very subtle gold foil texture applied via a CSS background-clip on the text. Beneath it, a single clean line in a lighter weight reads his role at Google — something like "Software Engineer at Google" — in a warm off-white. Below that, in a smaller italic style with a slight opacity, the subtitle reads: *"This portfolio is redesigned each day by AI — you are seeing a unique, ever-changing creation."* This subtitle has a very slow, gentle shimmer animation — a moving linear gradient highlight that sweeps across the text every few seconds, reinforcing the idea of constant change.

## The Bookshelf

The bookshelf itself is constructed as a CSS grid of wooden shelves — three rows of two books each, plus a bottom row for the social links. The shelves are rendered with a realistic wood-grain texture (CSS gradient trickery or an inline SVG pattern), with visible thickness on each plank edge to sell the 3D illusion. Small decorative items sit between and beside the books on each shelf: a tiny globe, a miniature cactus, a coffee mug, a rubber duck — all rendered as simple but charming inline SVGs or CSS illustrations with subtle idle animations (the globe slowly rotates, steam wisps rise from the mug).

Each project is represented as a **physical book** standing upright on a shelf. The six books have distinct visual identities:

1. **GlglStats** — A vibrant book with a spine in saturated magenta-pink, featuring a small sound-wave icon embossed on the spine. The title runs vertically along the spine in a clean sans-serif.
2. **Ahuzat Dibuk** — A book with a teal-green cover and a small car/parking icon on the spine. Slightly taller than the others.
3. **2D Part Orienting** — A thinner, academic-looking book in muted navy blue with a geometric polygon icon on the spine, evoking a textbook.
4. **The Turing Jest** — A playful, slightly tilted book in bright yellow-orange with a jester hat icon on the spine, leaning casually against its neighbor.
5. **Rhymes of Israel** — A medium-sized book in rich purple with a quill-and-scroll icon, its cover showing faint rhyming couplet lines as texture.
6. **Portfolio (Meta)** — A book in deep burgundy with an infinity symbol or recursive-mirror icon on the spine, slightly glowing at the edges to hint at its self-referential nature.

Each book has a 3D CSS transform giving it thickness (visible top edge and spine). On hover, a book **tilts toward the viewer** with a smooth CSS 3D rotation (rotateY about 15-20 degrees), its shadow shifts, and the reading lamp brightens slightly in response. A soft "paper rustling" feeling is conveyed by the easing curve.

## Opening a Book (Project Details)

When a user clicks a book, it animates **pulling out of the shelf** — it translates forward and rotates open using a CSS 3D transform with perspective, simulating the book cover swinging open. The rest of the scene dims slightly with a backdrop blur. The open book becomes a **two-page spread** centered on screen:

- **Left page**: The project title in a handsome serif heading, a short paragraph description of the project written on the page with a slightly indented, book-like paragraph style. The text color is dark sepia-brown on a cream/parchment-colored page background with faint paper grain texture. A small colored illustration or icon related to the project sits at the top of the page like a chapter illustration.

- **Right page**: Contains the relevant links, styled as elegant underlined references with small icons — a chain-link icon for websites, a play-button icon for YouTube, a newspaper icon for news articles, a code-bracket icon for GitHub repos. For the GlglStats book, the YouTube video of the PyData talk is embedded as a small inline player right on the page. For Ahuzat Dibuk, the three links (two news stories, one Facebook post) are listed as numbered references like footnotes in a real book. For 2D Part Orienting, the link goes to the TAU project page. For The Turing Jest and Rhymes of Israel, their respective links. For the meta Portfolio book, the link points to geekip.dev with a playful note about recursion.

Each open page spread has a subtle page-curl shadow along the center crease. A small "×" styled as a bookmark ribbon in the top-right corner closes the book, animating it sliding back into the shelf.

## Bottom Shelf — Social & Links

The bottom shelf of the bookcase is slightly different: instead of books, it holds three small framed photographs or plaques leaning against the back wall of the shelf. Each frame is styled as a small CSS-rendered picture frame with a brass or dark wood border. Inside each frame is an icon (GitHub's octocat, LinkedIn's "in" logo, Facebook's "f") rendered in a vintage engraved illustration style (monochrome, slightly crosshatched). Beneath each frame, the handle/URL is written in a tiny elegant caption. Hovering a frame gives it a gentle tilt and a warm glow. Clicking opens the respective profile in a new tab.

## Footer — AI Credit & Stopwatch

Below the bookshelf, on what appears to be the study floor (a dark hardwood texture), there is a small brass plaque — rendered as a rounded rectangle with a metallic CSS gradient border and a slightly embossed look. On the plaque, in an engraved serif italic: *"This edition was crafted by Claude, an AI by Anthropic."* Below the plaque, a mechanical flip-clock-style stopwatch shows the elapsed time since February 8, 2026 at 01:59:47 UTC. The digits are styled as split-flap display segments — each digit is a small card with a top and bottom half, and when a digit changes (every second for seconds, etc.), the top half flips down with a 3D CSS rotation animation to reveal the new number, mimicking a vintage airport departure board or a retro desk clock. The format reads: **XXXXd XXh XXm XXs** — days, hours, minutes, seconds — in warm cream text on dark charcoal cards. This ticking clock is the only continuously moving element, grounding the page with a sense of living time.

## Typography & Color

The overall palette is warm and moody: deep walnut browns, dark emerald-green wall, cream and parchment for the open book pages, and antique brass/gold accents. The books themselves are the primary color pops — each in its own distinct hue. Body text uses "Cormorant Garamond" or similar elegant serif. UI labels and small text use "Inter" or "DM Sans" for clarity. All text on the open book pages is styled to feel like printed book typesetting — justified, with drop caps on the first letter of each project description.

## Responsiveness

On mobile, the bookshelf collapses into a single-column vertical stack of books lying flat (horizontal spines visible), still tappable. Tapping a book expands it in place into a single-page card-style layout rather than the two-page spread. The decorative items hide on small screens. The flip clock and plaque remain at the bottom, scaled down proportionally.
