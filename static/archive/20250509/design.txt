# Adaptive Portfolio Design Concept for Geva Kipper

## Core Concept
A machine learning-based portfolio that personalizes itself based on user interactions. The site begins with a minimal, clean interface that evolves as the user engages with it.

## Header Section
- Geva Kipper's name prominently displayed in a modern, variable font that subtly shifts between weights
- Subtitle: "Software Engineer at Google, working on cutting-edge machine learning applications"
- Second subtitle in slightly smaller type: "This website redesigns itself daily using AI - what you see is unique to today"
- A subtle animation showing a neural network structure that reacts to mouse movements

## Dynamic Personalization Elements
- Color scheme that gradually adapts based on sections the user hovers over longer
- Small floating UI element indicating "learning in progress" as the site analyzes interaction patterns
- Visual cues that suggest the site is adapting to preferences (elements subtly reorganizing, colors shifting)

## Projects Display
- Five equal-sized project cards arranged in a horizontal scrollable interface
- Each card initially appears as a simple, geometric shape with minimal information
- As users hover or interact, cards expand with rich visuals, descriptions, and links
- Project cards feature subtle gradient backgrounds that shift based on mouse position
- Each project has a unique animated icon representing its technology focus

### GlglStats Card
- Waveform visualization that animates when hovered
- Embedded link to the project site and conference presentation video
- Small interactive demo showing a simplified version of the repetition visualization

### Ahuzat Dibuk Card
- Miniature heat map visualization that responds to cursor movement
- Links to media coverage and original publication
- Small animated icon showing a parking lot filling and emptying

### 2D Part Orienting Card
- Geometric animation showing polygon orientation process
- Link to the computational geometry library
- Interactive element allowing users to draw a simple shape and see orientation simulation

### Portfolio Website Card (Self-referential)
- Meta design showing "website within website" recursive visualization
- Link to the deployed version
- Small animation showing the ML personalization concept

### Social Links Card
- Minimal, elegant icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook
- Icons that grow and animate when approached by cursor
- Visual cues connecting these platforms to relevant projects

## Footer
- Clean, minimal footer with AI credit: "Design generated by [Your AI Model Name]"
- Elegant stopwatch showing time elapsed since May 9, 2025, with a subtle animation for seconds
- Small "reset personalization" button to let users restart the adaptation process

## Technical Aesthetic
- Primarily monochromatic with accent colors that adapt to user preference
- Typography using variable fonts that adjust weight and spacing based on importance
- Smooth transitions between all states with subtle easing functions
- Responsive design that maintains the personalization concept across all device sizes
- Light/dark mode toggle that remembers preference but also suggests optimal mode based on time of day

## Unique Interactive Elements
- Cursor trail that leaves "learning patterns" behind as users navigate
- Small ML insights panel that can be expanded to show what the site has "learned" about preferences
- Option to save the current design as a snapshot before it evolves further
