### Website Design: "The Geva Kipper Generative Portfolio"

**Core Concept:** The entire website is a single, full-screen, interactive piece of generative art. This background art is not static; it's a living canvas that subtly morphs and shifts constantly. Each day, the core algorithm uses the date as a "seed" to generate a completely new visual themeâ€”new color palettes, new shapes, new movement physics. This makes the website's core claim tangible. The portfolio content doesn't exist in traditional boxes but as interactive nodes within this generative space.

**Initial View & Header:**
Upon loading, the user is presented with a wide view of the generative art canvas. In the center, in clean, bold, and elegant white typography, is the name:

**Geva Kipper**
*Software Engineer at Google, focusing on large-scale data processing and machine learning infrastructure.*

Immediately below, a smaller, slightly glowing subtitle explains the site's nature:
*This portfolio is algorithmically redesigned by an AI every 24 hours. The visuals you see today are unique.*

The background art is active from the startâ€”perhaps a slow-moving field of geometric particles, a flowing digital watercolor simulation, or a network of pulsing neurons. The look is different every day.

**Navigation & Layout:**
The six project sections and the final contact section are not stacked vertically. Instead, they appear as seven interactive "nodes" or "islands" floating within the generative art space, arranged in a loose, aesthetically pleasing constellation around the central header. Faint, glowing lines connect them, suggesting a mind map or neural network.

The user navigates by scrolling. Each scroll snap smoothly animates the camera, panning and zooming through the 2D space to focus on the next node in the sequence. This creates a journey-like experience rather than a simple scroll-down.

**Project Node Design:**
Each project "node" is a semi-transparent, "frosted glass" panel (glassmorphism) that allows the dynamic background to be visible through it. A subtle, colored glow, pulled from the day's generated palette, outlines the panel when it's in focus.

When the user's view is centered on a project, the background generative art subtly reacts to the project's theme. For example:
*   **GlglStats (Music):** The background particles might begin to pulse in a slow rhythm or arrange themselves into sine wave patterns.
*   **2D Part Orienting (Geometry):** The background elements might sharpen into clear lines and polygons.
*   **The Turing Jest (LLM):** The particles could momentarily form and dissolve letters and punctuation marks.

Each project panel is structured identically for consistency:
*   **Top:** The project title in bold. Next to it, small, minimalist icons indicate the core technologies (e.g., Python logo, C++ logo, brain icon for AI/LLM).
*   **Middle:** A concise, one-to-two-sentence description of the project.
*   **Bottom:** Stylized, glowing buttons for the links, not plain text hyperlinks. For example: `[â–· Watch Talk]`, `[âŽ˜ Read News Story]`, `[ðŸ”— Visit Site]`, `[Install Extension]`. Hovering over a button makes it glow brighter.

**Content for the Nodes:**

1.  **GlglStats:** The panel features a muted, auto-playing background video snippet from the PyData talk. The description highlights the use of LZ77 for musical analysis. Links: `[â†— Visit Site]`, `[â–· Watch PyData Talk]`.
2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk:** The panel shows an animated GIF of the parking heatmaps evolving over time. Links: `[âŽ˜ 13tv News]`, `[âŽ˜ Mako News]`, `[âŽ˜ Original FB Post]`.
3.  **2D Part Orienting:** The panel displays a clean, looping animation of a polygon being oriented by the "push plan" algorithm. Link: `[</> View Code & Paper]`.
4.  **The Turing Jest:** A dynamic text animation types out and explains a sample pun in the panel's background. Link: `[â†’ Try The Arena]`.
5.  **Rhymes of Israel:** An animation shows a news headline transforming into a rhyming, comedic version. Link: `[âœš Install Chrome Extension]`.
6.  **The Portfolio:** This meta project panel contains a simple mirror-like reflection of the generative art behind it. The description reads: "This website. A self-referential project where an AI visualizes my work in a new way each day." Link: `[âŸ³ You Are Here]`.
7.  **Connect:** The final node contains three large, clean icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Hovering causes them to animate subtly. Clicking them opens the respective profiles in a new tab.

**Footer:**
As the user scrolls to the final "Connect" node, a footer fades into view at the very bottom of the screen. It is fixed and remains unobtrusive. It contains two lines of text in a small, clean font:

*Design generated by a large language model. | Time since launch: [live stopwatch]*

The stopwatch will be a JavaScript counter dynamically showing the hours, minutes, and seconds that have passed since the timestamp `2025-07-07 01:13:27`.
