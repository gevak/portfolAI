# Portfolio Website Design for Geva Kipper: "Digital Glitch"

## Core Concept
A dark-themed single-page website with glitch art aesthetics. The site appears normal at first, but when elements are interacted with (clicked, hovered), they momentarily "break" with digital artifacts, screen tearing, pixel displacements, and color channel splits before returning to normal.

## Header Section
- Geva Kipper's name appears as large glitchy text that occasionally "malfunctions" on its own
- Underneath, a single clean sentence about his current work at Google
- A subtitle in a smaller, constantly shifting typewriter font explaining that the site is redesigned daily by AI
- Background features subtle scanlines and pixel noise that intensifies when scrolling

## Navigation
- Minimal navigation dots on the side that glitch when hovered
- Smooth scroll between sections with glitch transition effects

## Project Sections
Five project boxes arranged in a asymmetrical grid layout:

1. **GlglStats**: 
   - Background shows subtle waveform animations representing music
   - When clicked, the section "breaks apart" like a compressed image artifact
   - Video thumbnail and project link displayed with glitch hover effects

2. **Ahuzat Dibuk**:
   - Features a minimalist heatmap background that distorts when hovered
   - News links appear to "hack in" when the section is clicked
   - Data visualization elements that scramble and reform

3. **2D Part Orienting**:
   - Abstract geometric shapes that reorient themselves when interacted with
   - Technical C++ code snippets that "corrupt" when clicked
   - Project info appears through digital noise

4. **Portfolio Website**:
   - Meta section that references itself with recursive visual elements
   - Most unstable section that constantly exhibits minor glitches
   - "Inception-like" nested frames that show miniature versions of the site itself

5. **Social Links**:
   - GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook icons that disintegrate and reform
   - Each platform icon takes on glitch characteristics of that platform
   - Links appear to "break the fourth wall" of the website

## Visual Elements
- Color scheme: Dark background with neon accents (cyan, magenta, yellow)
- Typography: Monospace fonts with occasional corruption
- Animation: Subtle constant movement with more dramatic effects on interaction
- Texture: Digital noise, scan lines, and pixelation throughout

## Footer
- Credit to the AI model in glitching text
- A digital stopwatch counting time since May 12, 2025, with occasionally scrambling numbers
- When clicked, the entire page experiences a major "system crash" effect before resetting

## Technical Notes
- Glitch effects achieved through CSS animations, WebGL, and canvas manipulations
- Responsive design that adapts the glitch aesthetics to different screen sizes
- Subtle audio feedback (electronic glitch sounds) when major interactions occur
- Performance optimized to ensure glitch effects remain smooth
