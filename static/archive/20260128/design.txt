**Design Concept: "The System Restore"**

**Current State:** Post-Critical Error / Safe Mode
**Visual Style:** Cyber-Brutalist meets Modern Glassmorphism
**Color Palette:** Deep Void Black (#050505), Terminal Green (#00ff41), BSOD Blue (#0078d7), and Warning Orange accents.

**I. The Intro Sequence (The Crash)**
Upon loading the URL, the user is immediately confronted with a full-viewport **Blue Screen of Death (BSOD)**. It should mimic the modern Windows stop error (Sad Face `:( `), but the error code reads `CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED: GEVA_KIPPER_OVERLOAD`. The QR code on the screen, if scanned, simply loops back to the domain.
*   **Animation:** After 2.5 seconds, the blue screen glitches (chromatic aberration and visual tearing).
*   **The Reboot:** The screen snaps to black. A Bios/UEFI-style boot sequence scrolls rapidly in the top left corner in monospaced white text. It lists "Loading Memory... 100%", "Mounting Google Work Experience... OK", "Initializing AI Architect... OK".
*   **The Reveal:** The terminal text fades out, and the main "Desktop" UI slides into view with a smooth, eased-in animation.

**II. The Header & Hero Section**
The main interface looks like a high-end, futuristic developer dashboard or a "Recovery OS."
*   **Top Left:** "Geva Kipper" appears in bold, oversized sans-serif typography (Inter or Roboto).
*   **Status Indicators:** Next to the name, a blinking green dot pulsing "Online".
*   **The Byline:** Below the name, a highlighted single line: *"Currently engineering solutions at Google."*
*   **The AI Disclaimer:** Positioned prominently at the top right, styled like a system warning banner with a subtle glitch text effect: *"// SYSTEM NOTICE: This interface is re-compiled daily by an autonomous AI model. Layout volatility expected."*

**III. The Grid (Bento Box Layout)**
The main content is arranged in a responsive, CSS Grid "Bento Box" layout. The cards represent the projects. They should have a semi-transparent dark background (frosted glass/blur effect) with subtle borders that glow slightly upon hover.

*   **Box 1: GlglStats (Featured/Large Card)**
    *   **Visuals:** A dynamic background featuring an abstract audio-wave visualization or a data-compression histogram.
    *   **Content:** Title "GlglStats" followed by "LZ77 Compression Analysis of Israeli Pop."
    *   **Interactivity:** Two distinct, pill-shaped buttons. One labeled "Launch App" (links to glglstats.geekip.dev) and a secondary button with a 'Play' icon labeled "PyData Conference Talk" (links to YouTube). When hovered, the histogram bars in the background should animate.

*   **Box 2: Ahuzat Dibuk**
    *   **Visuals:** A stylized, top-down dark map of Tel Aviv with heat-map zones pulsating in red and green (representing parking occupancy).
    *   **Content:** Title "Ahuzat Dibuk." Description: "Real-time parking occupancy scraping & visualization."
    *   **Links:** A "Press Coverage" footer inside the box containing icons/links to Channel 13, Mako, and the original Secret Tel Aviv Facebook post.

*   **Box 3: 2D Part Orienting**
    *   **Visuals:** A minimalist aesthetic showing wireframe polygons rotating.
    *   **Content:** Title "2D Part Orienting." Text: "C++ Computational Geometry. Efficient push-plan algorithms."
    *   **Link:** "View Source & Docs" linking to the TAU CS project page.

*   **Box 4: The Turing Jest**
    *   **Visuals:** A split-screen chat interface graphic, reminiscent of an LLM battle arena.
    *   **Content:** Title "The Turing Jest." Text: "LLM Puns Arena & Evaluation Platform."
    *   **Link:** A "Enter Arena" button linking to jest.geekip.dev.

*   **Box 5: Rhymes of Israel**
    *   **Visuals:** A chrome extension puzzle-piece icon, but styled to look like an old-school high school yearbook photo frame.
    *   **Content:** Title "Rhymes of Israel." Text: "LLM-powered comedic headline rhymer."
    *   **Link:** "Add to Chrome" button linking to the Web Store.

*   **Box 6: The Meta Link (The Recursion)**
    *   **Visuals:** This box displays a live, scaled-down iframe or screenshot of the website *itself*. This creates a "Droste effect" (infinite mirror).
    *   **Content:** Title "Trace Reference." Text: "Self-referential portfolio pointer."
    *   **Link:** Links back to geekip.dev.

**IV. The Footer & Socials (The Status Bar)**
The bottom of the screen mimics a system taskbar.

*   **Social Connectivity module:** A dedicated, wide rectangular section at the bottom center. It contains large, neon-outlined icons for **GitHub**, **LinkedIn**, and **Facebook**. When hovered, they should light up in their respective brand colors (Purple for GitHub, Blue for LinkedIn/FB), mimicking a "port connection" status.
*   **System Credit:** Identifying text in the bottom left: *"Constructed by AI Model [Version Redacted]."*
*   **The Chronometer:** In the bottom right corner, a digital segmented display (red LEDs).
    *   It displays the time passed since **2026-01-28 01:14:47**.
    *   *Design Note:* Since this date is in the future relative to the current time, the design should emphasize the "Time Travel / Glitch" aspect. Show the counter as a negative countdown (e.g., `-08,942h 12m 45s`) with a label reading "T-MINUS SYSTEM SINGULARITY" or "EPOCH ERROR: NEGATIVE UPTIME."
