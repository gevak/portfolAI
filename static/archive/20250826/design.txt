### **Overall Design & Aesthetic**

The portfolio is designed as a single-page, dark-themed fantasy RPG character sheet. The background will be a high-resolution, non-distracting image of dark, textured parchment or aged leather. The primary font for headings will be a classic, slightly serifed fantasy font (like "Cinzel" or "MedievalSharp"), while body text will be a clean, highly readable sans-serif. Subtle, glowing animations, like faint runes pulsing around section headers or a soft glow on interactive elements, will add a modern, magical touch. The color palette will consist of parchment beiges, deep browns, with accents of gold for titles and a magical blue for links and interactive buttons.

### **Header: Character Profile**

At the top of the page, the developer's name, **"Geva Kipper"**, is displayed prominently in a large, gold, fantasy-style font. Directly beneath it, in a slightly smaller but still prominent font, is his title and current quest: **"Software Engineer at Google, on a quest to tame wild algorithms."**

To the right of the name and title, there will be a small, pulsating "status effect" icon (e.g., a swirling magical orb). Hovering over this icon reveals a tooltip with the subtitle: **"This character sheet is re-forged daily by an AI Scribe, its form ever-changing."**

### **Main Content: Attributes & Forged Artifacts**

Below the header, the page splits into two columns. The main, wider column on the right will be titled **"Forged Artifacts & Legendary Quests"** and will contain the six project boxes. The narrower column on the left will be titled **"Core Attributes"**.

### **Left Column: Core Attributes & Guilds**

This column acts as the stats panel. It will feature a list of key skills like `Python`, `C++`, `Machine Learning`, `Data Visualization`, and `Web Development`. Each skill will be presented with a stylized progress bar next to it, resembling a mana or experience bar, filled to a high level to indicate proficiency.

Below the attributes, a section titled **"Guild Links"** will house three iconographic crests. Each crest will represent a social link and will glow upon hover. They will link to:
*   GitHub (a crest with an octo-cat sigil)
*   LinkedIn (a crest with a stylized "in" sigil)
*   Facebook (a crest with a classic "f" sigil)

### **Right Column: The Six Project Boxes**

This section houses the six projects, each presented as a "legendary item" card with a distinct border and a unique, small, thematic icon (e.g., a musical note for GlglStats, a parking sign for Ahuzat Dibuk, a jester's hat for The Turing Jest).

1.  **GlglStats Card:**
    *   Title: **GlglStats, the Lute of Repetition**
    *   Description: A Python project which measures the repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression and visualizes patterns in famous songs.
    *   Links: Two glowing blue buttons labeled `[Examine the Research]` and `[View Recorded Lore (PyData TLV)]`.

2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk Card:**
    *   Title: **The Scryer's Map of Tel-Aviv**
    *   Description: A Python scraping project that collects parking lot occupancy statistics, generating heat-maps to guide city residents.
    *   Links: Three buttons labeled `[Town Crier's Report (13TV)]`, `[Second Report (Mako)]`, and `[Original Proclamation]`.

3.  **2D Part Orienting Card:**
    *   Title: **The Amulet of Efficient Orientation**
    *   Description: A C++ implementation of a novel algorithm for constructing a 'push plan' to orient any given polygon, integrated into an open-source library.
    *   Links: A single button labeled `[Inspect the Blueprints]`.

4.  **The Turing Jest Card:**
    *   Title: **The Arena of the Turing Jest**
    *   Description: An LMSYS-like arena where LLMs compete at generating and explaining puns, with human users rating their comedic prowess.
    *   Links: A single button labeled `[Enter the Arena]`.

5.  **Rhymes of Israel Card:**
    *   Title: **The Bard's Chrome Extension**
    *   Description: An LLM-powered Chrome extension that rewrites Israeli news headlines into comedic rhymes, in the style of a highschool yearbook.
    *   Links: A single button labeled `[Equip the Artifact]`.

6.  **Portfolio Website Card:**
    *   Title: **The Ever-Changing Character Sheet**
    *   Description: The very portfolio you are viewing, meta-magically forged to catalogue my quests and artifacts.
    *   Links: A single, shimmering button labeled `[Gaze Into the Mirror]`.

### **Footer: Scribe's Credit & Realm Chronometer**

At the very bottom of the page, separated by a thin, ornate horizontal line, is the footer. On the left, a small, italicized text reads: **"This character sheet was scribed by Claude, an AI artisan from Anthropic."**

On the right, a section titled **"Time Elapsed in this Realm:"** features a running stopwatch. It will display the time passed since 2025-08-26 05:21:10 in a monospaced, slightly digital font, creating a striking contrast with the fantasy theme. The format will be `[days] days, [hours] hours, [minutes] minutes, [seconds] seconds`.
