**Visual Concept & Atmosphere**
 The website functions as an immersive, browsable art piece utilizing a "Cyberpunk Lo-fi" aesthetic. The view is a fixed Isometric projection (45-degree angle) of a cozy, slightly futuristic "coder's den." The color palette should rely on deep slate greys, midnight blues, and vibrant neon accents (cyan, electric purple, and lime green) that act as the light sources. The lighting is dynamic; moving the mouse creates a subtle "flashlight" effect, casting soft real-time shadows from the 3D objects onto the isometric grid floor. To maintain performance, the style is "low-poly" but with high-quality textures and baked lighting.

**Header & Dynamic Introduction**
floating in the top-left corner of the viewport—breaking the 3D plane—is a sleek, glass-morphism panel containing the text.
*   **Headline:** "Geva Kipper" in a bold, geometric sans-serif font.
*   **Sub-headline:** "Software Engineer currently optimizing the future at Google."
*   **The AI Disclaimer:** Below this, a typewriter-style animation loops the text: *"This digital architecture is hallucinated daily by AI. Its form is ephemeral."* This text should have a subtle glitch effect every few seconds.

**The Room Layout & Interactive Objects**
The room is furnished with six distinct, clickable 3D assets. When the user hovers over an object, it levitates slightly and glows, indicating interactivity.

1.  **The Vintage Turntable aka "GlglStats"**
    *   **Visual:** A retro-futuristic vinyl record player sitting on a side table. The vinyl record spinning has a label visualized as a compressed data stream.
    *   **Interaction:** Clicking zooms the camera into the player. The record sleeve slide out, acting as the modal.
    *   **Content:** The title "GlglStats" appears at the top. The modal displays a compression graph. It contains the project description about LZ77 and pop charts, the link to the site, and an embedded YouTube player for the PyData TLV talk.

2.  **The Wall-Mounted Traffic Dashboard aka "Ahuzat Dibuk"**
    *   **Visual:** A glowing, transparent holographic screen mounted on the wall, distinct from the main computer. It displays a pulsing heat map of Tel Aviv.
    *   **Interaction:** Clicking expands the hologram into a full overlay.
    *   **Content:** Displays the project title and the parking lot scraping methodology. Includes the link to the original Facebook post and two "In the News" badges linking to the Channel 13 and Mako articles.

3.  **The Mechanical Arm aka "2D Part Orienting"**
    *   **Visual:** A small industrial yellow robotic arm on a workbench, constantly rotating a 3D polygonal shape into different orientations.
    *   **Interaction:** Clicking causes the arm to present the polygon to the screen.
    *   **Content:** A technical schematic overlay explains the C++ implementation and the "push plan" algorithm, linking to the University project page.

4.  **The Arcade Cabinet aka "The Turing Jest"**
    *   **Visual:** A miniature arcade machine in the corner. The screen shows two pixel-art robot heads facing off (fighting game style) with speech bubbles.
    *   **Interaction:** Clicking transitions the screen to the arcade dispaly.
    *   **Content:** Describes the LMSYS-like arena for pun-making LLMs. A "Play Now" button links to the project site.

5.  **The Digital Typewriter aka "Rhymes of Israel"**
    *   **Visual:** An old-school typewriter, but instead of paper, it projects a holographic scroll of Hebrew text that rewrites itself into rhymes as the user watches.
    *   **Interaction:** Clicking focuses on the holographic paper.
    *   **Content:** Explains the Chrome extension and the yearbook-style humor. A prominent "Add to Chrome" button links to the web store.

6.  **The Main Monitor aka "The Meta Portfolio"**
    *   **Visual:** The central desk features a standard monitor. On the screen is a recursive image of the isometric room itself.
    *   **Interaction:** Clicking triggers an "Infinite Mirror" effect where the camera dives into the screen, only to reset the view.
    *   **Content:** A modal pops up acknowledging the recursion: "You are here." + a link to geekip.dev.

**The Social Shelf**
On a floating bookshelf on the right wall, there are no books, but rather three glowing physical 3D artifacts:
*   A Crystal Octocat (GitHub Link).
*   A Blue Neon "In" block (LinkedIn Link).
*   A Blue "F" cube (Facebook Link).
Clicking these opens the links in new tabs immediately without a modal.

**Footer & Telemetry**
The bottom of the screen features a "System Terminal" bar running across the width, styled like a code editor status bar.
*   **Left Side:** A blinking cursor text: *"Architected by Large Language Model (User Current Session)."*
*   **Right Side:** A stark, monospaced digital clock labeled "T-MINUS / ELAPSED TIME (EPOCH 2026)". This stopwatch calculates the precise difference between the current time and **2026-01-18 01:18:43**. (If the current date is before this target, it counts down; if after, it counts up). The numbers tick rapidly, emphasizing precision.
