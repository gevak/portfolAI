# Domino Rally Portfolio Design

## Visual Concept

The page opens to a dark gradient background (deep navy to charcoal) with a single glowing button centered on screen labeled "PUSH". The developer's name "Geva Kipper" appears in elegant, light typography above it, with the subtitle "Currently engineering solutions at Google" just below. Beneath that, in subtle, italic text: "This website is re-designed daily by AI—an ever-changing digital experience."

When the user clicks the PUSH button, it depresses with a satisfying animation and triggers a cascading domino effect that reveals the entire portfolio from top to bottom.

## The Domino Cascade Mechanism

Each of the seven content boxes is initially represented as a standing domino tile, arranged in a carefully choreographed path that winds down the page in an S-curve pattern. The tiles are rendered in 3D perspective, standing upright at angles that suggest their imminent fall. They're sleek, minimalist rectangles with subtle gradients—each tile bearing only a project icon or number on its visible face.

When triggered, the first domino tips forward in smooth 3D rotation, hitting the second, which hits the third, creating a mesmerizing chain reaction. As each domino falls, it transitions into its expanded form: a full content card that slides into place and fades up from 20% to 100% opacity. The timing is staggered perfectly so users watch the cascade flow down the page over approximately 4-5 seconds.

## Content Box Design

Each fallen domino transforms into a frosted glass card with subtle backdrop blur, featuring a colored accent bar on the left edge—each project gets its own signature color (vibrant coral, electric blue, emerald green, golden yellow, purple, cyan, and silver for the final links box). 

**Box 1 (GlglStats)**: Shows a mini visualization of compression patterns with animated waves. Project title in bold, description text beneath, with two distinct CTA buttons: "Visit Project" and "Watch PyData Talk" with a small YouTube icon.

**Box 2 (Ahuzat Dibuk)**: Features a subtle heat-map gradient background. Three links presented as rounded pills: two news sources with station logos, one Facebook link with the FB icon.

**Box 3 (2D Part Orienting)**: Displays a rotating polygon outline animation. Clean technical typography with a single "View Research & Code" link.

**Box 4 (The Turing Jest)**: Shows two chat bubbles with ellipsis animations suggesting conversation. Playful typography with "Visit Arena" button.

**Box 5 (Rhymes of Israel)**: Chrome-style browser bar mockup at the top of the card with the extension icon. "Install Extension" button styled like Chrome's installation button.

**Box 6 (Meta Portfolio)**: A recursive visual effect—a tiny version of the domino cascade rendered within the card. "You Are Here" badge pointing to this box. Self-referential link styled as a loop arrow.

**Box 7 (Social Links)**: Three large, circular icon buttons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook, arranged horizontally with hover effects that create a small domino-tip animation.

## Footer & Credits

At the very bottom, centered in small, refined typography: "Designed by [AI Model Name] | Generated [timestamp]" followed by a live-updating stopwatch showing elapsed time since October 22nd, 2025, 01:07:19 in a monospace font with subtle pulsing colons between time units.

## Interaction Details

Users can replay the domino effect at any time via a small circular arrow button fixed to the bottom-right corner. Hovering over any completed card creates a subtle lift effect with enhanced shadow. The entire experience is smooth, with cubic-bezier easing functions that make the physics feel natural and satisfying. Mobile responsive version stacks dominoes vertically with the same cascade effect flowing straight down.
