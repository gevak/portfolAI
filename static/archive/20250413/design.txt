# Git Timeline Portfolio Design for Geva Kipper

## Core Concept
A scrollable timeline presented as a git commit history/branch visualization. The page simulates a terminal/code editor with a git log view that expands as you scroll, revealing Geva's career progression through "commits."

## Header
- Dark code editor-style header with terminal prompt showing `~/geva-kipper $`
- Name "Geva Kipper" rendered in ASCII art terminal style
- Single sentence about current work at Google appearing as if typed in real-time
- Subtitle explaining the AI-redesigned nature of the site appears as a "comment" in the code (with // or # prefix)
- Small branch indicator showing "main" in the corner

## Timeline/Git History View
- Central vertical line representing the main branch
- Each project appears as a "commit" with:
  - Commit hash (decorative)
  - Timestamp (representing when project was created)
  - Commit message (project name)
  - Branch visualization with connecting lines

## Project Cards
- Each project expands from its commit point when scrolled to
- Cards have terminal/code window styling with title bars
- Content appears as if being typed in real-time
- Project descriptions include syntax highlighting for code terms
- Links presented as command-line style elements with hover effects resembling cursor focus
- Small animations that simulate terminal commands running when project cards are in view

## Project-Specific Elements
1. **GlglStats**: Visualization of sound waves or compression patterns as background element
2. **Ahuzat Dibuk**: Mini heatmap visualization that animates when in view
3. **2D Part Orienting**: Simple animated polygon being oriented through pushes
4. **Portfolio Website**: Recursive "window within window" effect showing miniature version of the site itself
5. **Social Links**: Presented as a "git remote" list with terminal styling

## Interactive Elements
- Hover over commits to highlight that branch
- Clicking commit hash reveals "git show" with more project details
- Terminal cursor blinks in various sections
- Subtle matrix-like code rain effect in background, very subdued

## Footer
- Terminal-style prompt showing "Process completed"
- AI credit styled as a command-line signature
- Stopwatch presented as a continuously updating `uptime` command output
- Small ASCII art decoration

## Color Scheme
- Primary: Terminal dark background (#0D1117)
- Accents: Git branch colors (green #26A641, purple #8957e5, orange #F78166)
- Text: Monospace in light gray (#E6EDF3) and command highlights in cyan (#58A6FF)

## Animation
- Subtle typing effect for text elements
- Commit history expands as user scrolls down
- Branch connections animate when scrolling
- Projects appear to "run" like terminal commands when they come into view

## Responsive Design
- On mobile, the terminal window becomes narrower with adaptive font sizing
- Project cards stack vertically maintaining the branch visualization
- Touch-friendly expand/collapse interactions replace some hover effects
