A single-page “truck dashboard” portfolio that looks like the in-cab instrument cluster of a modern semi-truck at night: dark matte surfaces, subtle brushed metal textures, soft glows, and crisp, high-contrast typography. The entire page is framed like a dashboard housing with rounded corners and a slight perspective, as if the viewer is seated behind the wheel. A thin ambient LED strip runs along the top edge and slowly shifts hue (very subtly) to reinforce the “re-designed daily by AI” idea without being distracting. The UI language is a blend of automotive HUD + fleet telematics: modular cards, bold iconography, and data-forward microvisuals.

**Header area (top of the dashboard):** Centered like a vehicle model badge: **“Geva Kipper”** in a clean, premium sans (with a slightly condensed, cockpit feel). Beneath, a single sentence about his current work at Google (one line only, “status line” style, like a vehicle state readout). Under that, a smaller subtitle in a lighter weight: **“This site is re-designed each day by AI—an ever-changing dashboard.”** To the right of the header, place a “signal cluster” of small indicators (e.g., AI Regen / Theme / Layout / Palette) that visually suggests daily regeneration, with one indicator pulsing once every few seconds. To the left, a compact “driver ID” panel (avatar placeholder or minimalist silhouette) and “Route: Portfolio / One-page” breadcrumb to reinforce the vehicle metaphor.

**Primary layout (the instrument cluster + telematics tiles):** The main body is a grid that feels like dashboard modules. At the center is a large circular gauge (speedometer-style) labeled **“Engineering Output”** or **“Build Velocity”** with a needle that idles and gently moves. Around it are smaller half-dials and tiny sparkline strips labeled things like “Latency,” “Uptime,” “Curiosity,” “Shipping,” “Experiment Rate”—these are aesthetic, not exaggerated. Each project is represented as a **rectangular “dashboard tile”** that looks like a fleet metric card: title like a component label, a short description, a “metric row” (language, domain, key highlight), and a prominent action area with links (site, video, docs). When the user hovers a tile, it behaves like a physical button: slight lift, brighter edge glow, and an animated “scan line” sweeps across the card, like a diagnostic check.

**Six main project tiles + meta tile + social tile (arranged like a truck’s infotainment grid):** Use a 2-row layout of large tiles with consistent heights, but varied internal visuals so each feels unique. Each tile gets a small left-side “icon plate” (like a stamped metal pictogram) and a right-side mini-visualization relevant to the project (compression bars, heat map thumbnail, polygon outline, pun-score ladder, rhyme waveform, etc.). The tiles include:
1) **GlglStats** — Presented as an “Audio Compression Diagnostic” module. Show a tiny faux LZ77 “compression ratio bar” and a miniature repetition-pattern heat strip. Include the link **https://glglstats.geekip.dev** and a distinct “Play” button style link to the PyData TLV talk **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo** (rendered like an in-dash media control).
2) **Ahuzat Dibuk** — Styled as a “Parking Occupancy Telemetry” tile. The mini-visual is a small Tel-Aviv grid heat-map thumbnail with a legend band. Provide three clearly separated link chips labeled “News 13,” “Mako,” and “Facebook Post,” pointing to:

3) **2D Part Orienting** — Styled as a “Geometry Control System” tile. The mini-visual shows a polygon outline with arrows indicating a push plan. Include the info/code link: **https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/**
4) **The Turing Jest** — Styled as a “LLM Arena / Humor Benchmark” tile. The mini-visual is a tiny leaderboard strip with “Model A vs Model B” and a “Pun Score” needle meter. Link to **https://jest.geekip.dev**
5) **Rhymes of Israel** — Styled as a “Headline Rewriter Module” tile. The mini-visual is a two-line transform: headline → rhymed punchline, scrolling slowly like a ticker. Add the install link as a bright “Install Extension” button: **https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eainginjgdkpgolpjniijdihfbeeeklb**
6) **Portfolio Website (meta)** — Styled as a “Dashboard Skin Manager” tile, explicitly calling out the self-referential nature (“How meta: the dashboard is the project”). Include the link **https://geekip.dev** and a small “theme seed” readout to reinforce daily AI redesign.

**Last tile for social links (as a “communications console”):** A wide tile at the end labeled “Comms / Dispatch,” with three large, clean icon buttons (GitHub, LinkedIn, Facebook) and the URLs rendered as readable text beneath each:
- github.com/gevak  
- linkedin.com/in/gevakip  
- facebook.com/geva.kipper  
This tile should feel like a truck’s connectivity panel: subtle antenna icon, connection bars, and a calm “Online” status indicator.

**Navigation and flow (single page, no traditional menu):** Instead of a top nav, add a left-side vertical “gear selector” rail that doubles as section jumping: P (Profile), 1–6 (Projects), C (Comms). It looks like a gear indicator with illuminated letters; clicking scrolls smoothly to the corresponding tile row, while the active section glows. Add a thin “road line” progress bar at the bottom of the viewport that advances as you scroll, like distance traveled.

**Footer (bottom edge of the dashboard):** A slim, engraved-looking plate: “Generated by OpenAI (ChatGPT)” as the AI credit (small but clear). Next to it, a **stopwatch module** styled like a trip timer, labeled “Since ignition,” counting time since **2025-12-14 01:15:07** in **HH:MM:SS** with a gentle ticking animation. The stopwatch should look like an onboard trip computer readout (monospace digits, subtle backlight, tiny separator dots). The overall finish stays elegant: restrained motion, high legibility, and a cohesive “premium vehicle UI” aesthetic—creative without becoming gimmicky.
