Okay, here is the design description for the portfolio website:

**Overall Concept:**

A minimalist, single-page website with a clean aesthetic. The defining feature is its subtle, AI-driven variability. Each day, JavaScript slightly alters CSS variables affecting layout (like grid spacing, column widths within limits), color accents (hue shifts within a defined range), subtle background patterns, or transition speeds/styles for hover effects. The core structure remains consistent and usable, but the *feel* changes daily.

**Header Section:**

*   **Top:** Display "Geva Kipper" prominently in a clean, sans-serif font.
*   **Below Name:** A single sentence: "Software Engineer at Google, focusing on [Replace with Geva's specific area/product at Google if known, otherwise use a placeholder like 'large-scale systems' or 'developer productivity']." Use a slightly smaller font size than the name.
*   **Subtitle:** Below the Google sentence, display: "This site subtly redesigns itself daily using AI, offering a unique view each visit." This text should be clearly visible but less prominent than the name/title.

**Main Content - Five Sections:**

Arrange the five sections in a flexible grid layout (e.g., initially 2 columns, then 3, or a staggered vertical flow). The AI script will subtly adjust the grid configuration daily (e.g., changing `grid-template-columns` values slightly, adjusting gap sizes). Each section should appear as a distinct content block, perhaps differentiated by subtle background shading, faint borders, or primarily through whitespace.

3.  **2D Part Orienting:**

    *   **Description:** C++ implementation of an efficient 'push plan' algorithm for orienting polygons within the open-source CGAL library.
    *   **Links:**

4.  **AI-Powered Portfolio:**
    *   **Title:** Meta-Portfolio: This Website
    *   **Description:** This very portfolio, designed as a single-page application featuring subtle, AI-driven daily variations in its layout and presentation.
    *   **Links:**
        *   Button/Link: "View Live Site" (-> https://portfolio-dor1.onrender.com/) (Self-referencing)

5.  **Connect:**
    *   **Title:** Connect
    *   **Content:** Display prominent icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook, linking directly to Geva's profiles.
        *   GitHub Icon (-> github.com/gevak)
        *   LinkedIn Icon (-> linkedin.com/in/gevakip)
        *   Facebook Icon (-> facebook.com/geva.kipper)

**Footer Section:**

*   **Left/Center:** A small text credit: "Site design concept generated by [Your AI Model Name, e.g., Claude/ChatGPT] & dynamically adjusted daily."
*   **Right/Center:** A live stopwatch implemented with JavaScript. It should continuously display the elapsed time (HH:MM:SS format) since the fixed date and time: 2025-04-17 01:03:12 UTC (or specify timezone if needed). Label it clearly, e.g., "AI Design Iteration Time:"

**Visual Style Notes:**

*   **Colors:** Use a predominantly neutral palette (e.g., shades of grey, off-white). Incorporate one accent color that the AI script can subtly shift daily (e.g., changing the hue of a specific blue within a predefined range).
*   **Typography:** Use a modern, highly readable sans-serif font family. Maintain clear hierarchy through size and weight.
*   **Interactivity:** Implement subtle hover effects on links and section blocks (e.g., slight background color change, minor shadow lift, slight icon scaling). The *nature* of these effects (e.g., transition speed, color) could be part of the daily AI variation.
*   **Background:** Keep it clean, potentially with a very faint, almost imperceptible generative pattern (like subtle noise or thin line art) that also changes subtly daily.
*   **Responsiveness:** Ensure the single-page design adapts gracefully to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile). The AI-driven layout changes should respect responsive breakpoints and maintain usability.
