**Overall Scene:**

Visualize a clean, minimalist wooden or brushed-metal virtual desk surface viewed from a slightly elevated angle (isometric or near-isometric perspective). The background is a soft, subtly blurred gradient, suggesting a calm workspace environment. Lighting is soft and focused on the desk, creating gentle shadows beneath the objects.

**Header Area:**

Subtly integrated into the top area of the scene, perhaps appearing as elegantly etched text on the desk surface or on a slim, modern plaque placed near the back edge:
*   **Name:** Geva Kipper
*   **Sentence:** Software Engineer at Google, focusing on [Insert Geva's specific area/main task at Google in one concise sentence - e.g., "...developing large-scale infrastructure solutions."].
*   **Subtitle:** Positioned just below the name/sentence, in a slightly smaller, perhaps italicized font: "This site's design is regenerated daily by AI, offering a fresh perspective each visit." A tiny, abstract geometric icon (like interconnected nodes) could sit beside this subtitle.

**Interactive Objects on the Desk (Numbered 1-5):**

These objects are rendered in a clean, modern 3D style and are clickable. On hover, they subtly lift or glow slightly. Clicking an object triggers a smooth animation where a content panel elegantly slides into view from the side or bottom edge of the screen, overlaying part of the desk view (which might slightly dim or blur).

1.  **Object 1 (GlglStats):** A stylized, simplified graphic equalizer display or a minimalist vintage cassette tape model.
    *   **Panel Content:** Header "GlglStats". Text description: "Python project measuring Israeli pop-chart song repetitiveness using LZ77 compression, featuring visualizations of repetition patterns." Include a clear "Visit Site" button linking to `https://glglstats.onrender.com/` and a "Watch Presentation (PyData TLV)" button linking to `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo` (perhaps with a small video thumbnail).
2.  **Object 2 (Ahuzat Dibuk):** A miniature, abstract representation of a city block with tiny, glowing parking space indicators, suggesting a heatmap. Alternatively, a stylized toy car model.
    *   **Panel Content:** Header "Ahuzat Dibuk". Text description: "Python scraping & data visualization project tracking Tel-Aviv parking lot occupancy, generating heatmaps for residents." Include link buttons labeled "News Story (Channel 13)" (`https://13tv.co.il/...`), "News Story (Mako)" (`https://www.mako.co.il/...`), and "Original FB Post" (`https://www.facebook.com/...`).
3.  **Object 3 (2D Part Orienting):** A set of clean, interlocking geometric shapes (like minimalist puzzle pieces) or a rolled-up blueprint scroll with C++ syntax hints visible.
    *   **Panel Content:** Header "2D Part Orienting". Text description: "C++ implementation of an efficient algorithm for constructing a 'push plan' to orient polygons, contributed to an open-source computational geometry library." Include a "View Project & Code" button linking to `https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/...`.
4.  **Object 4 (Portfolio Meta):** A sleek, miniature laptop model open on the desk, perhaps displaying a wireframe sketch of the desk itself.
    *   **Panel Content:** Header "Portfolio Website". Text description: "This interactive 3D desk portfolio, showcasing my projects. Designed to be dynamically restyled by AI daily." Include a self-referential "View Live Site" button linking to `https://portfolio-dor1.onrender.com/`.
5.  **Object 5 (Social Links):** A minimalist Rolodex model or a small, elegant business card holder displaying abstract icons.
    *   **Panel Content:** Header "Connect". No lengthy text needed. Display clear icons/buttons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook, directly linking to `github.com/gevak`, `linkedin.com/in/gevakip`, and `facebook.com/geva.kipper` respectively.

**Content Panel Design:**

Each panel that slides in should have a clean, semi-transparent background (allowing the desk texture to subtly show through). Use clear typography with distinct headers. Buttons should be obvious and well-spaced. Include a small, elegant 'X' icon in the top corner of the panel to dismiss it smoothly, returning focus to the desk.

**Footer Area:**

Integrated subtly at the very bottom edge of the viewport, perhaps appearing as text on a thin strip matching the desk's accent color or directly on the blurred background:
*   **AI Credit:** "Site design concept generated by [Your AI Model Name]."
*   **Stopwatch:** A dynamically updating digital display showing "Time Elapsed Since Redesign Epoch: [HH:MM:SS]", counting up from 2025-04-17 05:28:19. Use a clear monospace font for the time display.
