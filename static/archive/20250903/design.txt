### Portfolio Design: The Digital Orchard

**Overall Concept:** The website is a single, full-screen, interactive scene depicting a serene, stylized night or twilight environment. The central theme is a "Digital Orchard" where ideas (projects) fall like leaves from an unseen, conceptual tree. The user interacts with these falling leaves to learn about each project. The aesthetic is elegant, minimalist, and tech-focused, blending nature with digital artistry. The background is not static but a slowly shifting gradient, suggesting the passage of time from dusk to deep night and back, reinforcing the "ever-changing" AI theme.

**Initial View (Above the Fold):**
Upon loading, the user is greeted with a dark, deep blue or charcoal background with a subtle, slow-moving aurora borealis effect in the upper third of the screen. The main elements are:

*   **Developer Name:** “Geva Kipper” is displayed prominently in the center, in a clean, white, slightly weighted sans-serif font. The letters subtly shimmer with a soft, pale light.
*   **Title:** Directly beneath the name, in a smaller font, is the single sentence: "Crafting search and intelligence experiments at Google."
*   **Subtitle:** Below this, a line of text in a thin, ethereal font reads: "This site is algorithmically redesigned each day by AI. What you see is one of countless possibilities." Next to this text is a small, glowing, geometric "AI" icon.
*   **Falling Leaves:** From the top of the screen, stylized, geometric leaves begin to gently fall and drift across the view. There are six distinct types of leaves, each with a unique color and a subtle, glowing vein pattern resembling a circuit board trace. They fall at varying speeds and rotation, creating a perpetual, calming motion. An unobtrusive instruction, "Catch a leaf to explore a project," fades in and out at the bottom of the screen.

**Interaction and Content Display:**
The page is initially devoid of project boxes. The content is revealed through interaction:

*   **Hovering:** When the user’s cursor hovers over a falling leaf, its descent slows, its glow intensifies, and the project's title (e.g., "GlglStats") materializes next to it in a small, elegant font.
*   **Clicking:** Clicking a leaf triggers the main animation. The leaf gracefully glides to the center of the screen, halts, and then "unfolds" or "blooms" into a project card. This card expands smoothly from the center of the leaf, pushing the developer's name and titles upwards to a header position. Any previously opened card gracefully folds back into its leaf form and drifts away. This ensures only one project is in focus at any time.

**Project Card Design (The "Boxes"):**
Each project card is a semi-transparent, dark-glass panel with a glowing border that matches the color of the leaf it originated from. The content within is immaculately organized.

1.  **GlglStats (Amber Leaf):** The card features the title, the Python project description, an embedded YouTube player for the PyData video, and a sleek button with a glowing border that says "Explore the Live Site," linking to `glglstats.geekip.dev`.

2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk (Cyan Leaf):** This card displays the title and project description. Below, three distinct buttons are presented side-by-side, each with an icon: a newspaper icon for the 13tv link, a different newspaper icon for the Mako link, and a Facebook 'f' icon for the original post.

3.  **2D Part Orienting (Silver Leaf):** The card presents the C++ project's title and description, followed by a single, prominent button labeled "View Algorithm & Code" that links to the TAU project page.

4.  **The Turing Jest (Magenta Leaf):** The card features the title and description, with a playful pun icon (e.g., a "ha-ha" speech bubble). A clear call-to-action button reads "Play The Turing Jest," linking to the site.

5.  **Rhymes of Israel (Green Leaf):** This card shows the title and description, accompanied by an icon of a newspaper with a quill. The button is styled to look like an "Install" button, reading "Add to Chrome."

6.  **The Portfolio (Iridescent/White Leaf):** A meta touch. This card is titled "This Website." The description reads: "An ever-evolving portfolio concept, designed by AI and built with modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase a collection of projects as interactive elements in a digital ecosystem." The button simply says "Refresh" and links to `geekip.dev`.

**Footer and Persistent Elements:**
Once the first leaf is clicked and the content area is established, the footer elements appear, fixed to the bottom of the viewport.

*   **Social Links:** In the bottom-left corner, a clean, horizontal row of three glowing icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook, linking to the respective profiles.
*   **AI Credit & Stopwatch:** In the bottom-right corner, two lines of text appear.
    *   The top line: "Design generated by a large language model."
    *   The bottom line features a live stopwatch with the label "Time since last full redesign:" followed by a continuously updating counter of hours, minutes, and seconds since 2025-09-03 01:00:41. The numbers are displayed in a glowing, digital-style font.
