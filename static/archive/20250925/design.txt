### Portfolio Design: The Debugger

**Overall Concept:** The visitor arrives at a seemingly broken, unstyled, and chaotic webpage. A "debugging console" guides them through a series of "fixes" (clicks) that progressively build the final, elegant website. Each fix applies a layer of CSS or JavaScript, transforming the chaos into a polished, interactive portfolio.

**Initial State: The "Broken" Page**

Upon loading, the page is intentionally unstyled and dysfunctional. It resembles a browser's raw HTML rendering on a stark white background with default Times New Roman font and blue/purple hyperlinks.

*   **Layout:** All elements are stacked vertically in a single column with no padding or margins. Images may be oversized or not loaded, showing broken image icons. Some text elements are scrambled or contain placeholder "error" text like `[object Object]` or `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null`.
*   **Header:** At the very top, a fixed, jarringly styled "compiler error" message box with a red background and monospace font. It reads: `FATAL ERROR: 'styles.css' and 'main.js' failed to load. DOM rendered with fallback. Initiate debugging protocol to restore functionality. [CLICK HERE TO RUN DEBUGGER]` This is the user's only initial call to action.
*   **Content:** The six project boxes and the links section are jumbled together as plain text. Links are present but look like default hyperlinks. There is no clear separation between sections.

**Interactive Phase: The "Debugging" Process**

Clicking "RUN DEBUGGER" does not reload the page. Instead, a sleek, semi-transparent "debug console" overlay slides in from the bottom or right side of the screen. The console has a dark theme with glowing, monospace text. It will now prompt the user with a series of actions.

1.  **First Prompt:** The console displays `> Initializing... Found 7 content nodes. Style definitions not found. [APPLY 'layout-grid.css']`. The user clicks the bracketed command.
    *   **Effect:** The seven content boxes instantly animate from their vertical stack into a clean, modern two-column grid. The page gains proper margins and padding. The background shifts to a very dark navy blue (#0a192f). The website structure is now visible, but the content is still raw text.

2.  **Second Prompt:** The console displays `> Grid applied. Font rendering is suboptimal. [APPLY 'typography.css']`. The user clicks.
    *   **Effect:** All text instantly transitions. Headings become a clean, slightly futuristic sans-serif font (like 'Inter' or 'Poppins'), and body text becomes a highly readable sans-serif. The developer's name, "Geva Kipper," becomes large, crisp white text at the top. The subtitle below it animates in with a subtle flicker effect, hinting at the "AI-generated" theme.

3.  **Third Prompt:** The console displays `> Typography updated. Missing color palette and interactive elements. [APPLY 'theme-and-fx.js']`. The user clicks.
    *   **Effect:** This is the final and most dramatic transformation.
        *   A color palette is applied: The dark navy background remains, text becomes a soft off-white, and hyperlinks and interactive elements gain a vibrant electric blue or magenta accent color.
        *   The project boxes transform into cards with a subtle glassmorphism effect (frosted background) and a thin, glowing border that brightens on hover.
        *   Content within the cards organizes itself: Project titles become prominent, descriptions are formatted, and links become stylized buttons with icons (e.g., a play icon for the YouTube video, a GitHub logo, a newspaper icon for news).
        *   The scrambled `[object Object]` text is replaced with the correct project information through a quick, satisfying "decoding" animation.

4.  **Final Message:** The console displays `> Debugging complete. All systems nominal. Welcome to Geva Kipper's portfolio.` The console then minimizes into a small, glowing terminal icon in the bottom-right corner, which can be clicked to re-open and "view logs."

**Final State: The "Debugged" Elegant Portfolio**

The page is now a sleek, polished, single-page website.

*   **Header:** "Geva Kipper" is the main title. Below it, in the electric-blue accent color, is his role: "Software Engineer at Google." The subtitle, "This site is re-designed each day by an AI and is thus ever-changing," has a very subtle, slow-fading "glitch" effect, where a character might change for a millisecond every few seconds.

*   **Project Grid:** The six project cards are arranged in a responsive grid. On hover, the card's glowing border intensifies, and a "View Project" prompt appears. Clicking a card does not navigate away; instead, it expands the card in-place or opens a modal window overlay. This modal contains:
    *   **GlglStats:** The title, description, and two prominent buttons: "Visit Site" and "Watch PyData Talk."
    *   **Ahuzat Dibuk:** Title, description, and three buttons: "News Story (13TV)", "News Story (Mako)", "Original Post."
    *   **2D Part Orienting:** Title, description, and one button: "View Algorithm & Code."
    *   **The Turing Jest:** Title, description, and one button: "Visit The Arena."
    *   **Rhymes of Israel:** Title, description, and one button: "Install Chrome Extension."
    *   **This Website:** Title ("The Debugger Portfolio"), a meta-description of the site's concept, and a self-referencing button: "View Source (geekip.dev)."

*   **Links Section:** The final card is styled differently. It's simpler and just contains three large, iconic buttons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook, which glow with the accent color on hover.

*   **Footer:** At the very bottom of the page, centered, are two lines of text in a smaller, monospace font:
    *   `// Site design generated by a large language model.`
    *   `RUNTIME: [A digital stopwatch dynamically counting up from September 25, 2025, 01:07:43 in HH:MM:SS format].` This counter adds a final, quirky, and slightly futuristic touch.
