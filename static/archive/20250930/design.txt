# Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Career Journey Design

The portfolio opens with a weathered, parchment-textured background reminiscent of classic adventure gamebooks. At the top center, "GEVA KIPPER" appears in a bold, pixelated retro-game font with a subtle CRT monitor scanline effect. Directly beneath, in smaller elegant serif text: "Currently engineering solutions at Google," followed by an italicized subtitle in a typewriter font: "*This website is redesigned daily by AI—refresh tomorrow for a new adventure*"

The main interface presents as an interactive decision tree or branching narrative map. Six hexagonal nodes are connected by animated dotted paths that pulse with a soft glow, suggesting movement through different career chapters. Each hexagon floats slightly with a subtle parallax effect as the user scrolls or moves their mouse. The paths between nodes have small milestone markers (dots) that light up sequentially when hovering over connections, creating a sense of progression.

**Node 1 (GlglStats)** appears in the upper-left, styled as a vinyl record disc with grooves representing repetitive patterns. When clicked, the hexagon expands into a card overlay with a dark gradient background. The title "GlglStats" appears in Hebrew-style lettering with musical note decorations. Below, descriptive text explains the Python project measuring Israeli pop-chart song repetitiveness through LZ77 compression. Two prominent buttons appear: "Visit Project" (linking to glglstats.geekip.dev) styled as a play button, and "Watch PyData TLV Talk" (YouTube link) styled as a red record button with a duration timestamp icon.

**Node 2 (Ahuzat Dibuk)** sits to the right, designed as a parking sign icon with a heat-map color gradient (blue to red) pulsing within it. The expanded card shows miniature car icons arranged in a grid pattern that animate to show parking occupancy. The title uses Hebrew characters integrated into English text. Three link buttons are styled as license plates: one for each TV news story (Channel 13 and Mako) and one for the Facebook publication, with small media outlet logos as badges.

**Node 3 (2D Part Orienting)** appears below-center-left, visualized as a rotating polygon shape that continuously reorients itself. The hexagon contains geometric line art suggesting computational thinking. When expanded, the card displays an animated demonstration of a simple shape being pushed into orientation with directional arrows. The title uses a monospace technical font. A single prominent link button leads to the Tau project page, styled as a technical blueprint with grid lines.

**Node 4 (The Turing Jest)** is positioned center-right, designed as a comedy club spotlight or stage with two microphones representing competing LLMs. The hexagon has a warm spotlight glow effect. The expanded card shows a mock battle-arena interface with vs. typography between two AI avatars. Comic-style "HA HA" and "POW" text bubbles float in the background. The link button is styled as a vintage comedy club ticket stub leading to jest.geekip.dev.

**Node 5 (Rhymes of Israel)** sits lower-right, illustrated as a Chrome browser icon merged with a scroll or yearbook. Hebrew letters playfully bounce around the edges. The expanded card displays before/after examples of headlines transformed into rhymes, with the original appearing serious and the rhymed version in a playful yearbook font with decorative borders. The Chrome Web Store install button is prominently styled as a browser extension puzzle piece in Chrome's colors.

**Node 6 (Portfolio Meta)** appears at the bottom center, designed as an Escher-like infinite loop or ouroboros (snake eating its tail), representing self-reference. The hexagon contains a miniature recursive version of itself. When expanded, the card shows a infinite mirror effect with portals getting smaller. The text humorously acknowledges the meta nature: "You are here" with an arrow pointer. The self-reference link button is styled as a möbius strip leading to geekip.dev.

**Node 7 (Social Links)** is positioned at the very bottom, designed as a treasure chest or achievement unlock box. Instead of expanding into a full card, clicking it causes three smaller badges to slide out: a GitHub octocat icon, a LinkedIn logo, and a Facebook icon, each acting as a direct link. These badges have a glossy, collected-item appearance like achievement tokens in a game.

Between the nodes, faint storyline text appears along the connecting paths when hovering, such as "Explored data visualization..." or "Discovered computational geometry..." or "Experimented with LLMs...", reinforcing the adventure narrative theme. Small directional arrow indicators suggest which path to explore next, though users can navigate freely.

At the bottom of the page, below all nodes, a footer section appears on aged paper texture. On the left side: "Story crafted by Claude (Anthropic) - AI Dungeon Master of the Day" in a fantasy game master font. On the right side: a vintage LCD-style digital stopwatch display showing "Time Since Last Reality Check: [X] hours [Y] minutes [Z] seconds" counting up from 2025-09-30 01:03:57, with the numbers flipping mechanically like an old airport departure board.

The color scheme uses deep indigo and midnight blue backgrounds with warm amber and gold accents for interactive elements. Hovering over any node causes it to glow with a soft white aura and elevate slightly with a shadow effect, while the connecting paths brighten. The overall aesthetic balances retro gaming nostalgia with modern minimalist UI principles—clean, responsive, and engaging without overwhelming the content.
