### Portfolio Design: "System Breach"

**Overall Concept:**

The website loads into what appears to be a stark, minimalist terminal interface. A scripted "hacking" sequence automatically plays out, appearing to breach a secure system and decrypt files. These "files" are the portfolio projects. The aesthetic is clean, dark-themed, and text-focused, using a monospaced font, subtle animations, and a single accent color (e.g., electric cyan or lime green) against a near-black background.

**Initial Load & Animation Sequence:**

1.  **Black Screen & Cursor:** The user is first greeted with a completely black screen and a single, blinking block cursor (`_`) in the top left corner.

2.  **Automated "Hack" Script:** After a one-second pause, text begins to type out automatically, line by line, simulating a command-line sequence. Each line appears with a slight delay.

    ```
    > INITIATING_CONNECTION...
    > AUTHENTICATION_BYPASSED. ACCESS_GRANTED.
    > RUNNING_DECRYPTOR_V2.1...
    > TARGET: GEVA_KIPPER.PKG
    > DECRYPTING PAYLOAD... [##########] 100%
    > RENDERING INTERFACE...
    ```

3.  **The Reveal:** As the final line, "RENDERING INTERFACE...", types out, the entire "hack" script text glitches for a moment, then rapidly scrolls up and fades away. It is replaced by the main content of the portfolio, which animates smoothly into view from the center of the screen. The background shifts from pure black to a very dark gray (#111111) with a subtle, slow-moving grid or circuit board pattern.

**Main Page Layout:**

The layout is clean and structured. A main header is followed by a grid of five content boxes.

**Header Section:**

*   **Main Title:** At the top left, in a larger, bold monospaced font:
    `USER: Geva Kipper`
*   **Job Description:** Directly below the name, in the accent color:
    `STATUS: Software Engineer at Google, crafting the future of cloud infrastructure.`
*   **AI Subtitle:** At the top right, styled like a system comment:
    `// SYS_MSG: This interface is procedurally re-designed daily by AI. Visuals may vary.`

**Project Boxes / "Decrypted Modules":**

The five boxes are arranged in a grid. They are distinguished by a thin, 1px border in the accent color. On hover, the border brightens, and a very subtle "static" or "glitch" overlay effect appears on the box. Each box has a title styled like a filename.

**Footer:**

A thin, horizontal line separates the main content from the footer. The footer text is smaller and slightly dimmer than the main content.

*   **AI Credit:** On the left:
    `// DESIGN_RENDERED_BY: AI_MODEL/Gemini_1.5`
*   **Live Stopwatch:** On the right, a live counter:
    `// TIME_SINCE_GENESIS_EVENT [2025-06-12 01:08:10]:` followed by a dynamically updating clock showing `[XXX hours, XX minutes, XX seconds]`.
