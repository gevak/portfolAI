### Website Design: The "Neural Core" Portfolio

#### **Overall Concept**

The website is a single, dark-themed page presenting a minimalist, abstract visualization of a neural network or a digital circuit board. At the center is a glowing "core" node containing the developer's identity. Faint, dark, and un-clickable outlines of five other nodes are scattered around it, connected by dormant, thin pathways. Solving a micro-puzzle presented by the active node "powers up" the next node in a sequence, making it interactive and revealing its content. The aesthetic is clean, futuristic, and focused on smooth animations and user interaction.

#### **Initial View & First Puzzle**

Upon loading, the screen is almost entirely black with a subtle, slow-drifting grid of faint dots in the background, giving a sense of digital space. In the center, a single, pulsating geometric shape (a clean hexagon) glows with a soft, white light.

Inside this central hexagon, the text is displayed in a crisp, modern sans-serif font:

**Geva Kipper**
*Software Engineer at Google, crafting solutions for large-scale data systems.*

Below this, a smaller, italicized subtitle:
*This site's design is regenerated daily by an AI. What you see is unique to today.*

At the bottom of this central node is the first puzzle: A small, visual logic challenge. It displays two simple, animated visual sequences made of basic shapes (e.g., `▲-■-■` and `●-◆-●`). Below them are three other sequences. The user must click on the sequence that shares the same repetition pattern as the first one (`▲-■-■`). This is a nod to the 'GlglStats' project's theme of repetition.

#### **Unlocking and Navigation**

Once the puzzle is solved, a bright line of light animates, flowing from the central node along a dormant pathway to the first project node, causing it to light up and become clickable. This process repeats for each puzzle, creating a sequential path of light that connects all the nodes. Visitors can always click back on previously unlocked nodes.

#### **The Five Content Nodes**

When a user clicks on an unlocked node, it expands smoothly into a clean, borderless overlay panel. The rest of the site dims into the background. Each panel has a consistent layout: Project Title, a brief description, and clearly demarcated links with icons.

1.  **GlglStats Node:**
    *   **Puzzle:** (Already solved to unlock this).
    *   **Content Panel:** An abstract, silent animation of the LZ77 visualization (lines compressing and decompressing) plays subtly in the panel's background.
    *   **Links:** "View Live Project", "Watch PyData Talk".

2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk Node:**
    *   **Puzzle:** A 3x3 grid is displayed, representing a map. The squares pulse with varying intensities of red. The prompt reads: "Identify the hotspot." The user must click the brightest, most intensely pulsing square.
    *   **Content Panel:** A stylized, minimalist heatmap graphic is visible.
    *   **Links:** "Channel 13 News", "Mako News Story", "Original Facebook Post".

3.  **2D Part Orienting Node:**
    *   **Puzzle:** A non-convex polygon shape is displayed next to a target outline. Three animated "push paths" (curved lines) appear. The user must click the one path that correctly guides the polygon into the target orientation without it getting "stuck".
    *   **Content Panel:** A simple wireframe animation shows a polygon being pushed and oriented.
    *   **Links:** "Project Details & C++ Code".

4.  **Portfolio Website Node:**
    *   **Puzzle:** A single line of pseudo-code is shown: `if ( a = b ) { unlock_final_node( ); }`. The prompt is: "Find the bug." The user must click on the single equals sign (`=`).
    *   **Content Panel:** A simple, recursive image of the website's neural network layout itself is shown.
    *   **Links:** A single, prominent link: "View The Source Of This Site".

5.  **Contact & Socials Node:**
    *   **Puzzle:** This node is unlocked automatically after the fourth puzzle is solved, completing the circuit. The final connecting line of light illuminates it.
    *   **Content Panel:** No puzzle, just direct access. The panel displays three clean, universally recognized logos for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook, which light up on hover. Clicking a logo opens the corresponding profile in a new tab.

#### **Footer**

At the very bottom of the page, in small, unobtrusive text that is always visible, is the footer:

*Design generated by a large language model. Time elapsed since last system reset: [HH:MM:SS]*

The [HH:MM:SS] is a live stopwatch, dynamically counting up from the timestamp 2025-06-30 01:14:19, adding a final, peculiar, and tech-centric detail to the experience.
