# Binary Flux Portfolio Design

## Visual Concept

The entire page exists on a dark charcoal background (#1a1a1a) with a subtle animated grid of faint binary digits (0s and 1s in #2a2a2a) slowly cascading down like digital rain in the far background. The main content floats above this foundation in a centered column with maximum width of 1200px.

## Header Section

At the top, "Geva Kipper" appears in a custom monospace font at 48px, where each letter occasionally flickers with a brief bit-flip animation - individual pixels within the letterforms randomly invert between foreground and background colors. Below the name, a single line in cyan (#00d9ff) states his current work at Google. Beneath that, an italicized subtitle in a muted gray (#888) explains the AI-redesigned nature of the site, with the text subtly glitching every few seconds as if bits are corrupting and self-correcting.

## Bit-Flip Transition Mechanism

Each of the six project boxes is represented as a large rectangular card (280px height, full column width) with rounded corners. The cards are arranged in a 2x3 grid on desktop, single column on mobile. When hovering over any card, it triggers a mesmerizing bit-flip transition: the entire card appears to decompose into a grid of individual pixels (16x16px squares), which then flip like dominos from top-left to bottom-right, revealing the expanded "active" state. The flip animation shows each pixel rotating 180 degrees on its Y-axis, with one side showing the card's resting state color and the other side revealing the expanded state. The cascade takes approximately 0.8 seconds, creating a wave effect.

## Card Design States

**Resting State:** Each card displays only the project title in bold white text (24px) centered vertically and horizontally, with a unique accent color bar (6px thick) running along the left edge. Project 1 (GlglStats) uses vibrant magenta (#ff006e), Project 2 (Ahuzat Dibuk) uses electric blue (#0066ff), Project 3 (2D Part Orienting) uses neon green (#39ff14), Project 4 (The Turing Jest) uses golden yellow (#ffd700), Project 5 (Rhymes of Israel) uses hot pink (#ff4791), Project 6 (Portfolio Meta) uses purple (#9d4edd).

**Expanded State:** Upon the bit-flip completion, the card expands to approximately 400px height and reveals a two-column layout inside. The left 40% contains the project title at the top, followed by a concise description in light gray text (14px, #bbb) explaining what the project does. The right 60% contains all associated links styled as inline chips with the accent color as background, white text, rounded corners, separated by small gaps. For GlglStats, beneath the links, there's a small embedded video player thumbnail. For projects with news coverage like Ahuzat Dibuk, small news outlet favicons appear next to the link chips.

## Seventh Box - Social Links

The seventh box breaks the pattern - it's half-height (140px) and spans the full width at the bottom of the grid. In resting state, it shows three monochrome icons (GitHub, LinkedIn, Facebook) evenly spaced. The bit-flip animation here works differently: when hovering over any icon, only that icon's section (one-third width) cascades through the bit-flip, revealing the full clickable link with the platform name beneath the icon, now in full color (GitHub: #333, LinkedIn: #0077b5, Facebook: #1877f2).

## Footer

Below all cards, a thin horizontal rule in dark gray (#333) separates the content from the footer. The footer contains two lines: the first credits the AI model in small italic text (#666) aligned left, and the second shows a live-updating stopwatch on the right displaying "Site age: Xd Xh Xm Xs" since the specified timestamp, with the numbers highlighted in the cyan accent color (#00d9ff) and updating every second.

## Interaction Details

When no card is hovered, the page breathes with subtle ambient animations - the background binary rain continues falling, card accent bars pulse very gently in brightness. Clicking anywhere outside an expanded card triggers a reverse bit-flip cascade (bottom-right to top-left) to collapse it. Only one card can be expanded at a time; selecting a new card collapses the current one with the reverse animation while simultaneously beginning the forward animation on the new card, creating a synchronized digital wave across the page.
