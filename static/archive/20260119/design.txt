**Visual Concept: The "Magitech Archive" Interface**

**Overall Aesthetic & Atmosphere**
The site is designed as a high-fidelity, futuristic RPG character menu / inventory screen, blending "Magitech" aesthetics (magic meets technology). The background is a deep, animated void—a dark indigo canvas with floating geometric particles and faint, scrolling code snippets in the background. The UI elements use "Glassmorphism" (frosted glass) with neon borders that pulsate slowly. The cursor is custom-styled as a glowing gauntlet or a floating magical crystal. When the user moves the mouse, it illuminates the area beneath it like a torch in a dungeon, revealing hidden grid lines.

**Header: The Character Sheet**
The top section mimics an RPG "Status Screen."
*   **Avatar:** On the left, a stylized photo of Geva Kipper framed inside a hexagonal shield generator.
*   **Name & Class:** Large typography reads "Geva Kipper" with the class title "Software Engineer."
*   **Status Effect:** Below the name, a clear, elegant sentence: *"Currently crafting code at Google."* This text glows green, indicating an active 'buff' or status.
*   **The AI Anomaly:** The subtitle is presented as a "System Notification" or "Quest Log Update." It features glitch text effects (text characters rapidly cycling before settling) reading: *"Warning: Reality reconstructed daily by AI architecture."*

**Main Content: The Quest Inventory (The 6 Boxes)**
The projects are displayed not as standard divest, but as a 2x3 grid of "Legendary Item Slots." Initially, the slots look like locked chests or encrypted data cubes. As the user scrolls or hovers, the boxes "unlock" with a mechanical unlocking sound effect and animation (plates sliding open).

*   **Slot 1: The Bard’s Algorithm (GlglStats)**
    *   **Visual:** An icon of a vinyl record dissolving into binary code.
    *   **Interaction:** Hovering triggers an equalizer animation.
    *   **Data:** The description text appears like item stats. "Quest Item: GlglStats. Attributes: LZ77 Compression, Pattern Recognition." The buttons for the website and the PyData PyData YouTube video appear as "Equip" and "View Lore" buttons.

*   **Slot 2: The Urban Oracle (Ahuzat Dibuk)**
    *   **Visual:** A spooky, semi-transparent ghost hovering over a parking sign throughout a heatmap grid of Tel-Aviv.
    *   **Interaction:** The background of the card shifts colors (heat map style) on mouse movement.
    *   **Data:** Links to the TV news items and the Facebook post are styled as "Rumors discovered in the Tavern."

*   **Slot 3: The Geometric Key (2D Part Orienting)**
    *   **Visual:** A wireframe polygon rotating in 3D space.
    *   **Interaction:** Clicking the card causes the polygon to snap into a specific orientation, mimicking the algorithm’s purpose.
    *   **Data:** The C++ implementation/Info link is presented as a blueprint scroll.

*   **Slot 4: The Arena of Wits (The Turing Jest)**
    *   **Visual:** A robotic jester’s cap split down the middle—half medieval, half Terminator.
    *   **Interaction:** Two chat bubbles float up from the icon, exchanging punches (puns).
    *   **Data:** The link to the site is the "Enter Arena" button.

*   **Slot 5: The Scroll of Satire (Rhymes of Israel)**
    *   **Visual:** A chrome browser icon wearing a poet’s beret.
    *   **Interaction:** Headline text in the box background rapidly rewrites itself from standard font to a handwriting font on hover.
    *   **Data:** The installation link is styled as an "Acquire Skill" button.

*   **Slot 6: The Mirror of Recursion (Meta-Portfolio)**
    *   **Visual:** An image of the website itself, recursively shrinking into infinity (a Droste effect).
    *   **Interaction:** Hovering creates a ripple effect, as if touching water.
    *   **Data:** The link points to geekip.dev with the label "Cast Reflection."

**The Guild Hall (Social Links)**
Below the inventory grid is a horizontal bar styled like a "Party Member" selection or "Comms Array."
*   Three distinct rune stones represent **GitHub**, **LinkedIn**, and **Facebook**.
*   Hovering over them causes the rune to ignite with the brand's respective color (Purple/Black for GitHub, Blue for LinkedIn/Facebook) and project a holographic link.

**Footer: The Chrono-Anomaly**
The bottom of the page features a distinct visual break—the smooth glass UI cracks slightly, revealing a raw terminal command line.
*   **The Credit:** Monospace green text reads: *"Constructed by AI Model [Model Name]. Iteration Cycle: Continuous."*
*   **The Stopwatch:** A futuristic digital clock face, styled like a bomb timer or a time-machine flux capacitor. It displays the time elapsed since **2026-01-19 01:17:41**. Since this date is in the future relative to the current time, the counter displays a **negative countdown** (e.g., T-Minus: days/hours/minutes), labeled explicitly as *"Time Until Temporal Convergence."* If the date has passed, it counts up, labeled *"Time Since Singularity."*
