## The "Deva-gotchi" Portfolio Design

### Core Concept & Visual Identity

The website is designed as a single-page application framed within a virtual, custom-designed, retro handheld device, evoking the classic Tamagotchi look and feel. The color palette is a sophisticated dark mode, using a deep charcoal (`#1A1A1A`) as the background. The "screen" of the device is a slightly lighter grey (`#2A2A2A`) with a subtle CRT screen-line effect. All interactive elements, text highlights, and the pet itself glow with a vibrant, electric magenta (`#FF00FF`) and a cyber blue (`#00FFFF`), creating a striking contrast. Typography is a key element: headings and UI components use a crisp pixel font, while body text and descriptions use a clean, modern monospaced font for readability.

### The Header & The Pet

At the top of the page, centered on the "screen," lives the Deva-gotchi: a pixel-art creature that represents Geva's growth. It's a small, friendly robot composed of code symbols like `<>`, `{}`, and `//`. It idles with a subtle animation, such as a soft glow pulsing from its core or its antenna twitching. When the user loads the page or scrolls, the pet animates more expressively, as if acknowledging the interaction.

Directly above the pet, in the pixel font, is the name: **Geva Kipper**. Below it, in the clean monospaced font, is the single sentence: "Currently building the future of developer tools at Google."

Beneath this, a subtitle types itself out on a loop, with a blinking cursor: **"This site's design is regenerated daily by AI, making it a unique creation for today only."**

### Project Sections: The "Growth Cartridges"

Below the header, the six project sections are presented in a 3x2 grid. Each project is contained within a "cartridge"â€”a visually distinct rectangular box with rounded corners and a pixelated border. Hovering over a cartridge causes it to light up with a magenta glow, emit a soft, 8-bit chime, and makes the Deva-gotchi pet at the top look down and react with a happy animation, as if it's about to be "fed" a new skill.

Each cartridge contains:
*   **A unique pixel-art icon** at the top, representing the project (e.g., a musical note for 'GlglStats', a tiny car for 'Ahuzat Dibuk', a geometric shape for '2D Part Orienting').
*   **The project title** in the pixel font.
*   **A concise, one-sentence description** in the monospaced font.
*   **Action buttons** styled as chunky, 8-bit push-buttons. The text on the buttons is also in the pixel font (e.g., `[> VIEW SITE]`, `[â–¶ WATCH TALK]`, `[ðŸ“° READ NEWS]`, `[</> SEE CODE]`, `[INSTALL]`). These buttons glow blue on hover.

The six cartridges are presented as follows:

1.  **GlglStats:** Icon of a waveform. Links for `[> VIEW SITE]` and `[â–¶ WATCH TALK]`.
2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk:** Icon of a parking P. Links for `[ðŸ“° PRESS #1]`, `[ðŸ“° PRESS #2]`, and `[ðŸ’¬ FACEBOOK]`.
3.  **2D Part Orienting:** Icon of a polygon. Link for `[</> CODE & INFO]`.
4.  **The Turing Jest:** Icon of a comedy/tragedy mask. Link for `[> VIEW SITE]`.
5.  **Rhymes of Israel:** Icon of a newspaper. Link for `[INSTALL EXTENSION]`.
6.  **Portfolio.dev (meta):** Icon of a heart. A self-referential link on a button that reads `[? YOU ARE HERE]`.

### Footer & Socials

The final section at the very bottom of the page serves as the footer. The "7th box" of social links is integrated here for a clean finish. On the left, three pixel-art logos for **GitHub**, **LinkedIn**, and **Facebook** are displayed. They glow with the cyber blue accent color when hovered over.

On the right side of the footer, there is a small text credit: **"Site design for Geva Kipper generated by an AI assistant."**

Directly below this credit is a live stopwatch. It features a label in the monospaced font: **"Time since last universal reset:"** followed by a dynamically updating counter in the pixel font, displaying the hours, minutes, and seconds that have passed since 2025-08-05 01:16:34 in an `HHH:MM:SS` format. This ticking clock adds a sense of life and reinforces the site's ever-changing, generative theme.
