# Portfolio Design: "The Constellation of Visitors"

## Core Concept

The entire page presents as a deep space void—an infinite dark canvas sprinkled with subtle, slowly drifting star particles. Each visitor's cursor becomes a glowing celestial body, leaving behind a fading comet trail as they move. When visitors hover near each other, thin luminous threads connect their cursors like constellation lines, creating an ever-evolving star map drawn by the collective presence of everyone viewing the site simultaneously.

## Visual Foundation

The background is a rich gradient from near-black (#0a0a0f) to deep cosmic purple (#12101a), with micro-particles of varying opacity floating gently upward at different speeds. Each visitor cursor appears as a softly pulsing orb with a unique pastel color assigned randomly—mint, coral, lavender, gold, cyan—with a subtle glow aura. A small tooltip beside each cursor shows "Visitor from [City]" based on rough geolocation, appearing only when cursors come within proximity of each other.

## Header Section

Geva Kipper's name renders in a clean, wide-tracked sans-serif (Space Grotesk or similar), white text with a very subtle chromatic aberration effect that shifts slightly as the user scrolls. Below it, a single line in muted lavender: "Building intelligent systems at Google." 

Beneath this, in a smaller monospace font with reduced opacity, the subtitle pulses gently: "This design was dreamed up by AI on [today's date] — tomorrow brings a new universe." A small infinity symbol rotates slowly beside it.

A live visitor counter floats in the upper right corner, styled as a minimalist space station readout: "Currently exploring: 7 visitors" with small dots representing each connected user.

## Project Grid Layout

Six project cards arranged in an asymmetric masonry grid—not a rigid 2x3, but staggered heights and positions that feel organic, like floating platforms in space. Each card is a frosted glass panel (backdrop-blur with white at 5% opacity, thin 1px border of white at 10% opacity). Cards have generous padding and rounded corners (16px radius).

When a visitor's cursor enters a card, that card lifts slightly (translateZ) with an enhanced glow on its edges, and other visitors can see a subtle highlight indicating where someone is exploring—creating a sense of shared discovery.

### Card 1: GlglStats
Header icon: A sound wave morphing into a compression diagram. Title in bold white, description in silver-gray explaining the LZ77 compression analysis of Israeli pop repetitiveness. An embedded YouTube thumbnail with a custom play button overlay showing the PyData TLV talk. Below it, a pill-shaped button linking to the live site, styled with a gradient border that slowly rotates.

### Card 2: Ahuzat Dibuk
Header icon: A stylized car above a heat-map grid. The card features a small animated heat-map visualization (purely decorative CSS gradient blocks that pulse in different colors). Three compact link pills for the news stories and Facebook post, each with a small external link icon. Muted caption: "As seen on Channel 13 & Mako."

### Card 3: 2D Part Orienting
Header icon: An abstract polygon being nudged by directional arrows. More technical styling—perhaps a subtle grid background within this card only. Description mentions CGAL library contribution. Single link button to the TAU project page, styled with a blueprint aesthetic.

### Card 4: The Turing Jest
Header icon: A theater mask split between robot and human, one side laughing. Playful description about LLMs competing in pun battles. The card could have a rotating sample pun displayed in italics. Link button to the arena site with a "Judge the jesters" call-to-action.

### Card 5: Rhymes of Israel
Header icon: A newspaper page with a quill pen overlay. Description about the Chrome extension transforming headlines into yearbook rhymes. A mock headline example shown in a serif font, transforming into a rhyme with a typing animation. Chrome Web Store link styled with the Chrome colors subtly integrated.

### Card 6: This Portfolio (Meta)
Header icon: An ouroboros or recursive portal symbol. The card has a unique treatment—perhaps a subtle mirror effect or recursive border pattern. Self-aware description acknowledging the meta nature. Link to geekip.dev, with a wink emoji.

## Social Links Section

A horizontal bar with three circular icons (GitHub, LinkedIn, Facebook) rendered as simple white line icons inside glass circles. On hover, each fills with the brand's signature color. These float centered below the grid.

## Footer

Minimal footer in monospace: "Designed by Claude (Anthropic) • Day 1 of ∞"

The stopwatch sits beside it, styled as a digital readout counting up from 2025-11-30 01:14:37 in format "XXXd XXh XXm XXs since launch" with each number segment in its own subtle box.

## Interaction Details

Real-time cursors are WebSocket-powered, updating positions at ~30fps. When a cursor is idle for 5+ seconds, it gently dims and gains a "sleeping" indicator (tiny z's or moon icon). Cursors of users who leave fade out gracefully over 2 seconds. On mobile, users appear as stationary glowing orbs at their scroll position rather than cursor position.
