**Interactive Circuit Board Portfolio Design**

The website presents as a sleek, dark circuit board viewed from above, with subtle green traces connecting components across the entire viewport. The background is a deep charcoal (#1a1a1a) with glowing teal circuit pathways that pulse gently with a soft animation. At the top center, "Geva Kipper" appears as an elegant, illuminated chip label in clean white typography, followed by a single line describing his current work at Google in smaller, refined text.

Directly below the name, a subtle subtitle appears as if etched onto the circuit board: "This website is re-designed daily by AI - an ever-evolving digital experience" in italicized, slightly dimmed text that suggests the dynamic nature of the portfolio.

Five distinct electronic components are strategically positioned across the circuit board, each representing a project section. These components appear as realistic 3D renderings with soft shadows and subtle reflections. The first component, representing GlglStats, resembles a processing unit with Hebrew-inspired geometric patterns. The second, for Ahuzat Dibuk, takes the form of a sensor array with heat-map color gradients. The 2D Part Orienting project appears as a specialized geometric chip with angular edges. The portfolio meta-project manifests as a recursive display component showing a tiny version of itself. The final social links section presents as a connectivity hub with multiple output pins.

Each component glows with a soft amber outline when hovered, and clicking triggers a smooth expansion animation where the component opens like a folding origami structure, revealing project details in clean, floating panels with glass-morphism effects. The content panels feature refined typography, elegant spacing, and subtle animations for links and media embeds.

At the bottom right corner, a small digital display shows the AI credit and real-time stopwatch counting from the specified timestamp, styled as a authentic circuit board component with segmented LED-style numbers in bright green. The entire layout responds fluidly to different screen sizes, with circuit traces adjusting their paths and components repositioning organically while maintaining the cohesive circuit board aesthetic.
