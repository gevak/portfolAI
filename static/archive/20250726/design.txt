### Portfolio Design: "The Skill Collector"

**Overall Concept & Aesthetic:**
The website is a single-page, side-scrolling platformer presented with a clean, modern, and elegant "dark mode" aesthetic. The theme is a digital, abstract world, not a retro 8-bit game. The background is a very dark charcoal (#121212) with subtle, deep blue and purple undertones, featuring slow-moving, parallax layers of faint geometric grids and abstract code-like constellations to create depth. The "ground" or "path" the character walks on is a sharp, neon-accented line (electric blue or vibrant magenta) that guides the user down the page. The overall feel is sophisticated, interactive, and tech-focused.

**Header / Start Screen:**
Upon loading, the screen displays the name **GEVA KIPPER** in a large, bold, modern sans-serif font. Below it, a single sentence: "Software Engineer at Google, building the future of AI-powered developer tools." Underneath this, a smaller, monospaced font displays the subtitle with a subtle, animated "typing" or "glitch" effect: "This portfolio is re-designed daily by AI and is ever-changing."

To the left of this text, a small, stylized, minimalist character (the "player") stands at the beginning of the neon path. The character could be a simple, glowing humanoid figure or a sleek, geometric robot. A gently pulsing down-arrow icon invites the user to scroll.

**The Main Level & Interactive Scrolling:**
As the user scrolls down, the entire page functions as the game level. The player character automatically walks along the neon path, creating a seamless narrative journey. The scrolling action *is* the game control. At key points, the path rises to form a "platform" which represents a project. When a project section scrolls into view, the character stops next to a glowing "power-up" icon floating above the platform.

A Heads-Up Display (HUD) is fixed to the top-right corner of the screen. It's a small, semi-transparent bar labeled "SKILL INVENTORY" and contains six empty slots. As the character "collects" each project's power-up, its icon animates, flies to the HUD, and fills one of the slots, giving the user a sense of progression.

**Project Platforms (Sections 1-6):**

Each project is presented on its own "platform". When the character arrives, the project's information box elegantly fades or slides into view. These boxes are semi-transparent dark grey cards with sharp, neon borders matching the path's color.

1.  **Platform 1: GlglStats**
    *   **Power-up Icon:** A glowing Python logo combined with a soundwave visual.
    *   **Content Box:**
        *   **Title:** GlglStats
        *   **Description:** A Python project that measures the repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression and visualizes repetition patterns.
        *   **Links (Presented as sleek buttons):** `View The Site`, `Watch PyData Talk`

2.  **Platform 2: Ahuzat Dibuk**
    *   **Power-up Icon:** A data visualization graph icon mixed with a car symbol.
    *   **Content Box:**
        *   **Title:** Ahuzat Dibuk
        *   **Description:** A Python data-scraping project that collects and visualizes statistics on Tel-Aviv parking lot occupancy, generating heat-maps for residents.
        *   **Links:** `News: Channel 13`, `News: Mako`, `Original Post`

3.  **Platform 3: 2D Part Orienting**
    *   **Power-up Icon:** A C++ logo integrated with a complex polygon shape.
    *   **Content Box:**
        *   **Title:** 2D Part Orienting
        *   **Description:** An efficient C++ algorithm, implemented in a computational geometry library, for constructing a 'push plan' to orient any given polygon.
        *   **Links:** `More Info & Code`

4.  **Platform 4: The Turing Jest**
    *   **Power-up Icon:** A glowing brain or neural network icon with "haha" text bubbles.
    *   **Content Box:**
        *   **Title:** The Turing Jest
        *   **Description:** An LLM arena where large language models compete to generate and explain puns, with user-based rating and leaderboards.
        *   **Links:** `Visit The Arena`

5.  **Platform 5: Rhymes of Israel**
    *   **Power-up Icon:** The Chrome logo combined with a rhyming couplet symbol (e.g., two linked musical notes).
    *   **Content Box:**
        *   **Title:** Rhymes of Israel
        *   **Description:** A Chrome extension that leverages an LLM to rewrite Israeli news headlines into comedic, highschool-yearbook-style rhymes.
        *   **Links:** `Install Extension`

6.  **Platform 6: The Portfolio Itself (Meta)**
    *   **Power-up Icon:** A "refresh" or "recursion" symbol (a spiral or arrow looping back on itself).
    *   **Content Box:**
        *   **Title:** This Website
        *   **Description:** A meta-project demonstrating a unique, AI-generated, game-themed portfolio for a software engineer.
        *   **Links:** `View Source Domain` (links to geekip.dev)

**Final Section & Footer:**

After the sixth platform, the neon path terminates at a final, larger "end-of-level" podium. The character stands on top, having collected all the skills now visible in the HUD. Three large, glowing social media icons are presented on the podium.
*   **Icons:** GitHub, LinkedIn, Facebook.
*   Hovering over each icon makes it pulse brightly and reveals the corresponding platform's logo in a subtle way.

At the very bottom of the page, in a clean, centered footer separate from the game world, is the final text written in a small, elegant, white font:

"Site design by Claude 3 Opus. Time since last regeneration:" followed by a live stopwatch continuously counting up in `HH:MM:SS` from `2025-07-26 01:11:00`.
