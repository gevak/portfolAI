# Hacker Movie Aesthetic Portfolio Design

## Overall Visual Theme

The page opens with a full-screen terminal-style black background (#0a0a0a) with cascading Matrix-style green characters (in various shades: #00ff41, #00cc33, #008f11) raining down continuously in the background at varying speeds. A subtle CRT scanline effect overlays the entire page, creating horizontal lines that slowly scroll from top to bottom. Random glitch artifacts flash briefly across different sections every 3-7 seconds - pixel shifts, RGB color separation, and brief digital noise bursts. The cursor throughout the site is a blinking green square reminiscent of old terminals.

## Header Section

At the top, "GEVA KIPPER" appears in a monospace font (Courier New or JetBrains Mono) styled to look like ASCII art, with a typewriter effect that types out the name character by character on page load. The text glitches occasionally, briefly showing corrupted characters before snapping back. Below it, in smaller neon green text with a subtle glow effect, his role at Google types out: "Currently breaking prod at Google." This line occasionally flickers as if experiencing connection issues.

Immediately beneath, in a dimmed cyan color (#00ffff at 60% opacity), a subtitle reads: "< SITE.RECOMPILED_DAILY BY AI_ENTITY :: DESIGN.STATUS = VOLATILE >" with a blinking cursor at the end. This text has a slight horizontal chromatic aberration effect.

## Project Grid Layout

The six project boxes are arranged in a 2x3 grid layout with significant spacing between them. Each box is contained within a terminal window frame - complete with a fake title bar showing "root@geekip:~/projects$" and traditional minimize/maximize/close buttons (non-functional but aesthetic). The boxes have a dark translucent background (#0d1117 at 85% opacity) with bright green borders (2px solid #00ff41) that pulse gently. On hover, each box's border intensifies and develops a box-shadow glow, while the Matrix rain particles behind it temporarily scatter away from the box, creating a "force field" effect.

Each project box contains:
- A header line in bright green showing "> PROJECT_NAME.exe" in all caps
- A two-line description in lighter green (#33ff77) that types out on scroll-into-view
- Links styled as command-line inputs: "[ACCESS_LINK]", "[VIEW_DEMO]", "[READ_ARTICLE]" in cyan with underline-on-hover
- Small glitch animations trigger when hovering over links - brief color shifts and position jitters

The specific project boxes follow this pattern but with unique glitch signatures:
- GlglStats box occasionally shows binary numbers floating upward
- Ahuzat Dibuk displays brief heat-map color flashes (reds and oranges bleeding through)
- 2D Part Orienting shows rotating geometric wireframe overlays
- The Turing Jest box has text that occasionally rearranges itself humorously before correcting
- Rhymes of Israel has Hebrew characters briefly intermixing with the English text
- The meta portfolio box creates a brief "infinite mirror" effect with nested frames

## Social Links Section

The seventh box spans the full width at the bottom, styled as a command prompt showing:
"> ESTABLISH_CONNECTION --social-protocols"

The three links appear as:
"[GITHUB://gevak] [LINKEDIN://gevakip] [FACEBOOK://geva.kipper]"

Each link has a small icon formed from ASCII characters that glitches between different character combinations on hover.

## Footer

At the very bottom, in small, dimmed text (#00ff41 at 40% opacity):
"// DESIGN_GENERATED_BY: Claude-3.7-Sonnet | COMPILATION_TIMESTAMP: 2025-10-25_01:06:33"

Next to it, a live counter displays: "UPTIME: [XXh XXm XXs]" that updates every second, showing time elapsed since the timestamp. The counter occasionally glitches, showing corrupted numbers for a split second before correcting itself.

## Interactive Elements and Animations

Subtle parallax scrolling makes the Matrix rain move at a different speed than the content. Random "system messages" occasionally scroll across the top of the screen in a ticker-tape style: "> Compiling memories...", "> Neural pathways stable...", "> Creativity.dll loaded successfully...". 

Every 30 seconds, a brief full-screen glitch effect occurs - the entire page distorts with RGB separation, horizontal tearing, and digital artifacts for approximately 0.3 seconds before snapping back to normal, as if the simulation is momentarily unstable.
