The website opens on a fullscreen black background with the comforting glow of retro green monospace text. At the very top, a simulated **terminal prompt** types itself out letter by letter:  

```shell
geva@google:~$ ./portfolio.sh  
```

As soon as the command executes, the title "Geva Kipper" appears larger, in subtle glitch-animated ASCII art style. Below it, a single human-readable line fades in: *"Currently at Google, working on large-scale systems engineering."* Underneath that is a blinking prompt where the subtitle is “typed out” dynamically: *"This portfolio is re-designed each day by AI — and is thus ever-changing."*  

Beneath the header, the page behaves like an **interactive shell interface**, where each project is “discovered” by typing or clicking. Down the screen, six “modules” are displayed as neatly boxed entries that resemble modular console output. Each box has a **header line styled like a terminal command output** (e.g. `$ cat GlglStats.info`) followed by compact text, hyperlinks, and a small embedded content area (video or visualization thumbnail). Hover states mimic **CRT-style flicker effects.**  

- **GlglStats box** shows the description, followed by clickable green hyperlinks (`[project site]`, `[conference video]`) displayed inline, styled as if they were system “symlinks.”  
- **Ahuzat Dibuk box** presents two inline `[news story links]` and one `[Facebook post link]`, along with a miniature ASCII-generated heatmap animation running faintly in the background of the section.  
- **2D Part Orienting box** has the description accompanied by `[project website / source code]` link, with a faint rotating polygon rendered in ASCII-art strokes behind the text.  
- **The Turing Jest box** description is followed by `[visit arena]`, and when hovered, the box “tells a pun” via a glitch appear/disappear effect, showing how the site itself jokes with the user.  
- **Rhymes of Israel box** has `[Install extension]` as a bright-green highlighted button, and hovering reveals a rhymed transformation of the portfolio subtitle in a pop-up side panel.  
- **Portfolio Website (meta)** box links `[geekip.dev]`, with a reflective effect — as if the page “folds into itself” briefly to imply recursion.  

The social links box sits separated at the bottom, styled like a **~/socials directory listing**:  
```
-rw-r--r--  github.com/gevak  
-rw-r--r--  linkedin.com/in/gevakip  
-rw-r--r--  facebook.com/geva.kipper  
```  

The bottom footer has a blinking green cursor and small text crediting: *“This layout generated collaboratively with an AI (GPT-4).”*  
Next to it is a live **stopwatch timer** (hours:minutes:seconds) precise to the second, displayed in digital seven-segment style, counting from *2025-08-19 01:07:12*. It updates in real time and feels like part of the terminal session.  

The whole site has **subtle effects**: a soft scanline overlay, glowing text shadows on hover, and smooth scroll-triggered reveals that feel like terminal commands being executed (`ls`, `cat`, `echo`). Navigation is one-page only, but every "jump" to a section animates downward as if the terminal is auto-scrolling.  

The result is an elegant, highly interactive, and slightly playful **living command-line portfolio** that feels alive, AI-driven, and bespoke.
