The webpage opens with a fullscreen black background, with subtle animated flowing lines reminiscent of glowing circuit board traces gently drifting like currents. At the center is **Geva Kipper’s name** in large, elegant sans-serif typography, softly glowing in white-blue. Beneath it sits a one-sentence description: *“Currently building the future of AI systems at Google.”* Under that, a subtitle fades in: *“This portfolio is re-designed by AI each day — always evolving, never the same.”*  

The portfolio takes the form of a **living flowchart**, spanning down the single-page layout. Instead of standard scrolling, the visitor scrolls through a dynamic branching diagram, where each milestone/project is represented as a glowing rounded-corner “box” node, connected by animated curved lines. The whole structure looks like a constellation or subway map, with nodes arranged in a flowing, slightly meandering line that zigzags down the screen, making the site feel exploratory rather than strictly linear. The connecting lines gently animate, pulsing as if carrying energy, suggesting both connectivity and creativity. On hover, nodes softly expand, emit a glow, and their connecting lines brighten.  

Each node holds a short title and project description, with icons or tiny illustrative visuals that emphasize the project’s theme. Expanding a node (by clicking or hovering) reveals links and embedded media. For example:  
- **GlglStats**: A glowing blue box, symbolized with repeating waveforms, which expands to show the external link, and embeds a clickable YouTube thumbnail for the PyData talk.  
- **Ahuzat Dibuk**: Warm orange box with a parking lot minimalist icon, expanding to show news article links and the Secret Tel Aviv Facebook link.  
- **2D Part Orienting**: A sharp green box with tessellated polygon art, expanding to reveal the algorithm’s source code and academic link.  
- **The Turing Jest**: A playful purple box with a jester-hat icon and animated text fragments that morph into puns when hovered, revealing a link to the Jest site.  
- **Rhymes of Israel**: A quirky pink box with a scribbled notebook and rhyme symbols, linking to the Chrome extension.  
- **This Website**: A self-referential white-glow box, showing a looping infinite mirror animation, linking to geekip.dev.  
- **Profiles Box**: At the bottom of the flow, three clean social icons (GitHub, LinkedIn, Facebook) sit in a silvery-gray box styled like a terminal prompt.  

As the viewer scrolls, the flowchart gradually animates into place — nodes slide and snap into their connected positions, with smooth easing. Small floating particles drift between the nodes, giving the visualization a feeling of motion and growth.  

Finally, at the **footer zone**, the flowchart narrows into a single glowing line leading to a final text block: *“Designed today by an AI, rebuilt tomorrow anew.”* Just below, aligned bottom center, is a **stopwatch counter** in digital clock typography, continuously ticking to show the hours, minutes, and seconds elapsed since *2025-08-23 01:02:47.* Every second it updates smoothly, glowing brighter on each change.  

The overall feel balances **elegance and imaginative playfulness**: the portfolio is not a flat resume page, but a **living journey map**, where projects are milestones on a flowing digital river of creativity, with every scroll forward feeling like a step along Geva Kipper’s career story.
