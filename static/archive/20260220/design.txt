The website is a visually immersive, single-page skeuomorphic experience that blends modern web fluidness with photorealistic vintage audio equipment. The color palette revolves around warm walnut wood grains, matte black vinyl, brushed silver aluminum, and the warm amber glow of vintage amplifier vacuum tubes. The layout is split into two main sections: a top-down view of a highly detailed vintage turntable dominating the left side of the screen, and a beautifully distressed "Album Sleeve" taking up the right side acting as the main UI content area. 

The header information is presented on the cover of the album sleeve on the right. In elegant, large vintage serif typography reminiscent of classic jazz album covers, it reads "Geva Kipper". Beneath it, a sleek, modern sans-serif typeface bridges the gap to the present: "Designing the future of tech and building scalable software solutions at Google." Tucked into the top-right corner of the sleeve is a bright, eye-catching circular digital sticker that mimics a physical vinyl decal, rotating slowly and reading: "Dynamic Pressing: Re-designed each day by AI and thus ever-changing." 

The interactive centerpiece is the turntable on the left. The vinyl record has seven distinct visual rings (grooves) corresponding to the seven sections of the website. As the user hovers over or clicks a project on the tracklist on the right, the metallic tonearm physically animates, swinging over and dropping the needle onto the corresponding groove. This triggers a warm, glowing UI overlay mimicking "Liner Notes" that slides smoothly out from behind the album sleeve, presenting the project details. 

Track 1: "GlglStats" is detailed on a liner-note card featuring subtle audio-wave background graphics. The text explains the Python project measuring the repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression and visualizing the patterns. The links are styled as vintage backstage passes—one linking to the live site at https://glglstats.geekip.dev, and another containing a thumbnail linking to the PyData TLV presentation at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo.

Track 2: "Ahuzat Dibuk" features a faded thermal heatmap graphic layered under the text. It describes the Python scraping and data visualization project for Tel-Aviv parking lot occupancy. The external links are formatted like torn newspaper clippings pinned to the liner note, linking to the Channel 13 news item (https://13tv.co.il/item/news/domestic/internal/parking-902956407/), the Mako article (https://www.mako.co.il/nexter-news/Article-ae43964b891bf71027.htm), and a polaroid-style link to the original Secret Tel-Aviv Facebook post (https://www.facebook.com/groups/secrettelaviv/posts/10159636301195943/).

Track 3: "2D Part Orienting" takes on a retro-blueprint aesthetic with geometric wireframes. The text outlines the C++ implementation in an open-source computational geometry library to construct a 'push plan' for orienting polygons. A manila-folder-style tab provides the link to the CGL TAU project page: https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/.

Track 4: "The Turing Jest" is presented like a vintage comedy club ticket. The description covers the LMSYS-like arena where LLMs compete at making and explaining puns, rated by users. A bold, perforated "Admit One" button links to https://jest.geekip.dev.

Track 5: "Rhymes of Israel" utilizes a nostalgic highschool yearbook design with scribbled margins. It explains the Chrome extension utilizing an LLM to rewrite Israeli news headlines into comedic rhymes. A glossy, retro-styled "Install Extension" stamp links directly to the Chrome Web Store: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eainginjgdkpgolpjniijdihfbeeeklb.

Track 6: "The Meta Portfolio Website" presents a recursive, infinity-mirror graphic of the vinyl player itself. The text points out the meta nature of the very site the user is navigating. A glowing vinyl center-label links back to the root: https://geekip.dev.

Track 7: "The Outro Groove" acts as the final track. When the needle drops here, a "Fan Club Membership Card" slides out, featuring sleek icon-based links for social connections: GitHub (github.com/gevak), LinkedIn (linkedin.com/in/gevakip), and Facebook (facebook.com/geva.kipper).

At the bottom of the screen, embedded directly into the rich walnut texture of the turntable’s base layer, are two elements. First, a glowing, photorealistic Nixie-tube digital clock serving as a stopwatch, ticking up in real-time to show the exact hours, minutes, and seconds passed since 2026-02-20 01:25:30. Right beside it is an engraved, tarnished brass plaque that reads: "Website design conceptualized and generated by Claude [or applicable AI model name] - The Ghost in the Machine."
