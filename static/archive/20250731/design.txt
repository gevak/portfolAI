Here is the design for an interactive subway map portfolio website.

### **Website Design: The Geva Kipper Metro**

**Overall Concept & Feel:**
The website is a single, full-screen interactive map styled after a modern, minimalist subway system. The aesthetic is clean, elegant, and sophisticated, using a dark-mode theme with vibrant, glowing lines to create a high-tech, futuristic feel. The entire experience is smooth, with fluid animations and a focus on exploration. The background is a very dark charcoal grey (#1A1A1A) with a subtle, non-distracting grid texture, evoking an engineer's blueprint.

**Header & Subtitle:**
At the top-center of the screen, fixed in place, is the primary text.
- **Name:** "Geva Kipper" in a bold, clean, geometric sans-serif font (like Montserrat Bold), colored white.
- **Role:** Directly below the name, in a lighter weight of the same font and slightly smaller, is the sentence: "Solving complex problems with code at Google."
- **AI Subtitle:** Below that, in a monospace font (like Fira Code) with a faint, pulsing cyan glow, is the text: "This site is programmatically re-designed each day by AI. Layout is ever-changing." A blinking cursor animation appears at the end of this sentence.

### **The Interactive Map: Lines and Stations**

The map consists of several colored "metro lines" that crisscross the screen. Each line represents a core skill set. The "stations" are circular nodes on these lines, representing projects. Hovering over a station causes it to pulse, grow slightly, and reveal its name in a small tooltip. Clicking a station is the primary action.

**Lines:**
*   **Python Line (Vibrant Orange):** A long, winding line central to the map.
*   **AI/LLM Line (Electric Blue):** A prominent line that intersects with the Python line at key projects.
*   **C++ / Systems Line (Emerald Green):** A shorter, more direct line representing a specialized skill.
*   **WebDev Line (Magenta):** A small loop line, representing the meta-nature of the portfolio.
*   **Connect Line (Cool Grey):** A small, separate line segment for contact links.

**The Click Interaction:**
When a station is clicked, the entire map smoothly zooms and pans to center on that station. Simultaneously, a semi-transparent, dark glass panel slides in from the right side of the screen, occupying about 40% of the viewport. The project details appear here. The map remains visible but slightly dimmed on the left. Clicking a "close" icon (an 'X') on the panel or clicking on the map itself slides the panel away and returns the map to its default view.

### **The Stations (Content Sections):**

Each content panel has a consistent design: The Station Name (Project Title) at the top, followed by a concise description, and then clearly labeled buttons for links.

**1. Station: GlglStats**
*   **Location:** A major interchange station where the **Python Line (Orange)** and **AI/LLM Line (Blue)** intersect.
*   **Panel Content:**
    *   **Title:** GlglStats
    *   **Description:** A Python project that measures the repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression, featuring interactive visualizations of lyrical patterns.
    *   **Media:** An embedded YouTube player showing the PyData TLV presentation.
    *   **Links:** A button labeled "Explore the Data" linking to `https://glglstats.geekip.dev`.

**2. Station: Ahuzat Dibuk**
*   **Location:** A major station on the **Python Line (Orange)**.
*   **Panel Content:**
    *   **Title:** Ahuzat Dibuk
    *   **Description:** A data scraping and visualization project that collects real-time occupancy statistics for Tel-Aviv parking lots, generating predictive heat-maps for residents.
    *   **Links (Three distinct buttons):**
        *   "Channel 13 News Story"
        *   "Mako News Coverage"
        *   "Original Facebook Publication"

**3. Station: 2D Part Orienting**
*   **Location:** The main station on the **C++ / Systems Line (Green)**.
*   **Panel Content:**
    *   **Title:** 2D Part Orienting
    *   **Description:** An efficient C++ algorithm implementation for constructing a 'push plan' to orient any given polygon, contributed to an open-source computational geometry library.
    *   **Links:** A button labeled "View Code & Research" linking to the project page.

**4. Station: The Turing Jest**
*   **Location:** A major station on the **AI/LLM Line (Blue)**.
*   **Panel Content:**
    *   **Title:** The Turing Jest
    *   **Description:** An LMSYS-style arena where large language models compete to generate and explain puns. User votes determine the wittiest AI.
    *   **Links:** A button labeled "Visit the Arena" linking to `https://jest.geekip.dev`.

**5. Station: Rhymes of Israel**
*   **Location:** A station on the **AI/LLM Line (Blue)**.
*   **Panel Content:**
    *   **Title:** Rhymes of Israel
    *   **Description:** A Chrome extension that uses an LLM to humorously rewrite Israeli news headlines into rhyming couplets, in the style of a high-school yearbook.
    *   **Links:** A button labeled "Install The Extension" linking to the Chrome Web Store.

**6. Station: geekip.dev (This Site)**
*   **Location:** A station on the dedicated **WebDev Line (Magenta)** that forms a loop, referencing itself.
*   **Panel Content:**
    *   **Title:** The Ever-Changing Portfolio
    *   **Description:** You're looking at it. This interactive portfolio is a single-page application built with modern web technologies and designed around the concept of a subway map.

**Footer:**
A thin, static bar at the very bottom of the page.
- **Left Side:** Text in a small, elegant font reads: "Site design generated by a large language model."
- **Right Side:** A digital stopwatch with the label "Time since last manual update:" actively counting up in HH:MM:SS from the hardcoded start time of `2025-07-31 01:14:39`.
