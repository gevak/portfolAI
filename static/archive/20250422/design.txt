# Neural Network Portfolio Design Concept

## Overall Concept
The portfolio is designed as a living neural network visualization that responds to visitor interactions. The background features a sleek, animated representation of neural connections that react to mouse movements, clicks, and scrolling. The network's nodes and connections subtly pulse with a gradient of deep blues and subtle purples, representing data flowing through the system.

## Header
At the top, "Geva Kipper" appears in a bold, modern sans-serif font with a subtle glow effect. Beneath it, a single elegant line states: "Software Engineer at Google, developing intelligent systems that bridge human-computer interaction." Below this, a smaller subtitle reads: "This portfolio is re-designed daily by AI - return tomorrow for a new experience."

## Interaction mechanics
As visitors move their cursor across the page, neural nodes illuminate and connections between them strengthen. Each project section appears as a specialized "cluster" within the neural network, with unique visual characteristics representing the technology stack used.

## Project Sections
The five project sections appear as elegant, frosted-glass panels that float over the neural network background. Each panel has a subtle hover animation that expands the node connections around it when interacted with.

1. **GlglStats Panel**: Features a minimalist audio waveform visualization that subtly pulses. Contains project description, links to the site and the PyData TLV conference video. The panel's neural connections animate in patterns that mimic music repetition.

2. **Ahuzat Dibuk Panel**: Displays a stylized heatmap as its visual identity. Contains project description and links to news stories and original Facebook publication. The surrounding neural nodes use a color palette inspired by heatmap visualizations.

3. **2D Part Orienting Panel**: Features animated geometric shapes that continuously reorient themselves. Contains project description and link to additional info and code. The neural connections around this panel form geometric patterns.

4. **Portfolio Website Panel**: A self-referential design with a recursive visualization effect (neural network within a neural network). Contains a link to the rendered site with a subtle "You are here" indicator.

5. **Social Links Panel**: Three distinctive neural node clusters, each representing a platform (GitHub, LinkedIn, Facebook). When hovered, each platform's logo appears within its node cluster, with links to the respective profiles.

## Footer
A subtle footer contains credit to the AI model that created the design, styled as "Neural design by [AI Model Name]" alongside an elegant stopwatch displaying time elapsed since April 22, 2025, 01:03:03 in hours, minutes, and seconds - continuously updating in real-time.

## Responsive Behavior
On mobile devices, the neural network simplifies but remains interactive through touch, with project panels stacking vertically while maintaining their distinctive visual characteristics and animations.

## Color Scheme & Typography
Deep space-inspired background (dark blues, blacks) with vibrant neural connections in blues, purples, and occasional accent colors. Typography uses a clean, modern sans-serif for readability with a monospaced font for technical elements and project titles.
