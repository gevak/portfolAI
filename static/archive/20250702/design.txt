### Portfolio Design: The Skill Explorer

**Overall Concept:**

The website is a top-down, 2D explorable world, rendered in a clean, minimalist pixel-art style. The entire browser window is the game's viewport. The background is a dark, deep blue or charcoal grid, subtly animated to look like a digital blueprint or a starfield slowly drifting by. The user controls a small, brightly glowing white geometric shape (the "explorer") using the arrow keys. The goal is to navigate this space and interact with floating "nodes" that represent projects and information. The aesthetic is a sophisticated blend of retro gaming and modern, clean user interface design, with an emphasis on smooth animations and satisfying, subtle audio-visual feedback.

**Initial View & Header:**

Upon loading, the user sees the full explorable area. The explorer character materializes in the center with a soft chime. At the top of the screen, permanently fixed like a game's heads-up display (HUD), is the main title. The text "Geva Kipper" appears in a crisp, modern pixel font. Below it, in a slightly smaller font, is his role: "Software Engineer at Google, focusing on large-scale systems and data processing." Directly beneath this, a sub-header types itself out letter by letter on first load, stating: "This portfolio is procedurally generated by AI each day. The layout you see is unique to today." This text then fades slightly to be less prominent than the name. Simple instructions, "Use Arrow Keys to Explore," fade in and then out in the center of the screen to guide the user.

**The Explorable World & Interactive Nodes:**

The six main sections are represented not by boxes, but by distinct, animated pixel-art icons scattered across the digital landscape. As the user navigates the explorer character close to one of these nodes, it begins to glow brighter and emits a low, gentle hum, and its title (e.g., "GlglStats") appears above it. Colliding the explorer with a node triggers the main interaction.

Instead of a new page loading, a sleek, semi-transparent dark panel slides in from the right side of the screen, occupying about 40% of the viewport. The game world on the left remains visible but dims slightly, keeping the user in context. Each panel is cleanly designed with the project title at the top, followed by a concise description. Below the description are clear, actionable buttons for the provided links. The iconography is intuitive: a play button for the YouTube video, a chain-link for websites, a newspaper for news articles, a Facebook 'f' for the post, etc. When the user moves the mouse over a button, it glows with the same bright white as the explorer character. Closing the panel via an 'X' in its top corner or by pressing the 'Escape' key causes it to slide smoothly back out of view, returning focus to the game world.

Here is the design for each node:

1.  **GlglStats:** Represented by a floating, pulsating audio waveform icon. The panel will feature the description and two buttons: "Explore the Data" (linking to the site) and "Watch PyData Talk" (linking to YouTube).

2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk:** This node is a pixelated location pin icon that cycles through a heat-map color gradient (blue-green-yellow-red). The panel will have three buttons: "Haaretz News Story," "Mako News Story," and "Original Facebook Post."

3.  **2D Part Orienting:** The icon is a slowly rotating, complex, wireframe polygon. Its panel contains the project description and a single button: "View Project & Code on cgl.cs.tau.ac.il."

4.  **The Turing Jest:** Represented by an icon of two overlapping speech bubbles, one with a question mark and one with a lightbulb. The panel features one button: "Try The Turing Jest."

5.  **Portfolio Project (Meta):** This node is a pixel-art computer monitor icon. Displayed on the monitor is a tiny, recursive, animated version of the website itself. Its panel has one button: "View Source/Instance" linking to the portfolio's own URL.

6.  **Contact & Socials:** This is not a single node but a small, distinct "docking station" area in one corner of the map. It contains three static, smaller icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook, arranged side-by-side. Moving the explorer over any of them highlights that specific icon, and colliding with it directly opens the corresponding link in a new tab.

**Footer / HUD:**

At the very bottom of the screen, integrated into the fixed HUD, are two final elements. On the left, in a small, unobtrusive pixel font, is the credit: "Site design by a generative AI model." On the right-hand side is a stopwatch, styled like a classic digital clock, with the label "Time Since Epoch." It will be actively counting up in HH:MM:SS from the specified date and time (2025-07-02 05:34:02), adding a final touch of dynamic, live data to the experience.
