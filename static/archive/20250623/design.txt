Here is the design description for the portfolio website:

### Overall Concept: The Celestial Portfolio

The website is a single-page, interactive 3D environment. The user is presented with a minimalistic, elegant view of a solar system against a dark, deep-space background with a subtle, slowly shifting nebula effect in a cool color palette (deep blues, purples, and hints of cyan). The entire experience is fluid and controlled by the user's mouse or scroll wheel.

### The Initial View & Header

Upon loading, the camera is positioned to view the entire solar system from a slight angle. In the center glows the "Sun." Floating elegantly in the foreground, rendered in a clean, thin, white sans-serif font, is the primary text:

**Geva Kipper**
*Software Engineer at Google, crafting intelligent systems for global-scale products.*

Beneath this, in a smaller font with a subtle animated shimmer or glitch effect to emphasize its nature, is the subtitle:

*This portfolio is a unique cosmic instance, algorithmically redesigned daily by AI.*

### The Solar System: Navigation and Interaction

The user can click and drag to rotate the entire solar system, or use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out. The planets orbit the central sun at a slow, majestic pace. Hovering over any celestial body causes it to glow softly and its title to appear. Clicking on a planet or the asteroid belt initiates a smooth camera transition, zooming in to focus on that object while the rest of the system fades into the background.

### The Sun: Geva Kipper

The sun is the central, largest celestial body. It has a soft, white-gold pulsating glow. It is not clickable but serves as the anchor for the entire system, representing the developer himself.

### The Planets (Projects)

Four planets orbit the sun, each with a unique visual identity related to its project. When a planet is clicked and the camera zooms in, a clean, semi-transparent, dark-themed card Fades in to the right of the planet, displaying the project's information.

1.  **Planet 'GlglStats'**: A terrestrial planet with glowing, shifting patterns on its surface resembling audio waveforms or an EQ visualizer.
    *   **Card Content**:
        *   **Title**: GlglStats
        *   **Description**: A Python project measuring the repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression, featuring interactive visualizations of lyrical patterns.
        *   **Buttons**:
            *   "Explore the Data" (links to `glglstats.onrender.com`)
            *   "Watch PyData Talk" (links to the YouTube video, perhaps opening an embedded player)

2.  **Planet 'Ahuzat Dibuk'**: A vibrant city-planet, glowing with a grid of lights that subtly shifts in a heatmap pattern (from cool blue to warm red).
    *   **Card Content**:
        *   **Title**: Ahuzat Dibuk
        *   **Description**: A Python data project that scrapes and visualizes occupancy statistics for Tel-Aviv's public parking lots, generating predictive heatmaps for residents.
        *   **Buttons**:
            *   "As Seen on Channel 13" (links to `13tv.co.il` story)
            *   "Mako Nexter Feature" (links to `mako.co.il` story)
            *   "Original Facebook Post" (links to the Facebook post)

3.  **Planet 'Part Orienter'**: Not a sphere, but a slowly rotating, complex, crystalline polyhedron, representing computational geometry. Its facets catch the light from the central sun.
    *   **Card Content**:
        *   **Title**: 2D Part Orienting
        *   **Description**: A C++ implementation of an efficient algorithm that constructs a 'push plan' to orient any given polygon, contributed to an open-source computational geometry library.
        *   **Button**: "View Code & Algorithm" (links to `cgl.cs.tau.ac.il` page)

4.  **Planet 'Portfolio' (Meta)**: A metallic, reflective sphere that mirrors the starry background, giving it a 'mirror ball' effect. On its surface, faint wireframe grids and scaffolding animations are visible, suggesting it is a world under construction.
    *   **Card Content**:
        *   **Title**: The Celestial Portfolio
        *   **Description**: This very website. A self-referential, AI-generated, single-page portfolio built with modern web technologies to create an explorable universe of skills.
        *   **Button**: "View Source Orbit" (links to `portfolio-dor1.onrender.com`)

### The Asteroid Belt (Links)

Instead of a fifth planet, a sparse asteroid belt orbits between the inner and outer planets. This belt contains three larger, uniquely shaped asteroids. Hovering over an asteroid reveals an icon (GitHub, LinkedIn, Facebook). Clicking an asteroid navigates the user directly to the corresponding profile in a new tab.

### The Footer

Anchored subtly at the very bottom of the screen is a thin, faint line. Below it, in small, clean text:

*Cosmos constructed by GPT-4. Time elapsed since genesis: [Live Stopwatch: 000d 00h 00m 00s]*

The stopwatch is a live counter, continuously ticking up in days, hours, minutes, and seconds from the specified date and time of 2025-06-23 01:12:28.
