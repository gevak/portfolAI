### A Portfolio Inside a Retro, Playable Gameboy Emulator

**Overall Concept & Initial View**

The website occupies the entire browser viewport, styled to look like a classic, handheld Gameboy console. The console's body is a sleek, dark charcoal gray with a matte texture, giving it a modern, elegant twist on the retro design. Responsive design ensures the console and its components scale perfectly for desktop and mobile views.

Upon loading, the site executes a brief "boot-up" animation on the Gameboy's screen. The screen flickers to life with a pixelated, top-to-bottom wipe effect. A descending block logo appears, mimicking the original Nintendo logo, but it resolves to spell out "**GEVA KIPPER**". Below it, a single line of pixelated text types itself out: `> Currently building things at Google.` This boot sequence lasts only two seconds before transitioning to the main portfolio interface.

**The Screen & Interface**

The "screen" is the central content area, rendered with the iconic dot-matrix, greenish-monochrome aesthetic. All text uses a clean, readable pixel font. Directly beneath the Geva Kipper header, a subtitle is displayed with a subtle text-glitch effect that activates every few seconds, reading: `> This site's design is regenerated daily by AI.`

The portfolio is structured like a simple game menu. The five section titles are listed vertically on the left side of the screen. A small, 8-bit blinking arrow acts as a cursor, indicating the currently selected section. The user navigates this menu using the on-screen D-pad or their keyboard's arrow keys. As the user navigates up or down, the content on the right side of the screen instantly updates to reflect the selected section, accompanied by a soft, 8-bit "blip" sound.

**Interaction & Controls**

The Gameboy's buttons are fully functional elements for interaction:

*   **D-Pad:** Navigates the main menu (Up/Down).
*   **A Button:** Serves as the primary "action" or "select" button. When a section is highlighted, pressing 'A' will reveal its associated links. When a link is highlighted, pressing 'A' opens it in a new tab. This action is accompanied by a positive, 8-bit "confirm" chime.
*   **B Button:** Acts as the "back" or "cancel" button, used to hide the list of links and return to the section's main description. This has a softer "cancel" sound.
*   **Start Button:** Toggles a small overlay that displays a "Controls" guide.
*   **Select Button:** Cycles the screen's color palette through four options: Classic Green, Pocket Gray, Cool Blue, and a warm Amber, giving the user control over the aesthetic.

**Content Sections Display**

When a section is selected from the left-hand menu, its details populate the right-hand panel of the screen:

1.  **GlglStats:** The title is displayed prominently. The description follows below. Below the text, three interactive, selectable lines appear, each with a small icon: a link icon for the site (`[A] View Project`), a YouTube play-button icon for the video (`[A] Watch Presentation`), and a GitHub icon for the code (`[A] See Code`). The user uses the D-pad to select a link, which becomes highlighted, and presses 'A' to open it.

2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk:** Similar to the first, the title and description are shown. The links are presented clearly: `[A] News Story (13tv)`, `[A] News Story (mako)`, and a Facebook icon for `[A] Original Post`.

3.  **2D Part Orienting:** The title and C++ project description are displayed. The link is presented as a single interactive option: `[A] Algorithm & Code`.

4.  **Portfolio Website:** This meta-project is titled "This Gameboy." The description explains the concept. The single link is playfully labeled `[A] Restart Cartridge?` and links to the site's own URL.

5.  **Contact & Links:** The title is "Find Me Online." It doesn't have a description, but instead immediately shows three selectable lines with their respective icons: `[A] GitHub`, `[A] LinkedIn`, `[A] Facebook`.

**Footer & Final Details**

The final elements are not on the pixelated screen but are subtly integrated into the console's physical body below it, as if part of the manufacturing print. In a small, clean, modern sans-serif font (to contrast with the screen's pixel font), the credit is etched: `Design Concept by Claude 3 Opus`.

To its right, a small, separate LCD-style display is embedded into the console's plastic. This display houses the stopwatch, with sharp, digital numbers continuously counting up the hours, minutes, and seconds passed since `2025-06-23 14:24:31`. This creates a beautiful contrast between the retro "game" world and the real-time, ever-ticking clock. A tiny, pulsating red LED light sits next to the screen, "powering" the console. A mute button icon is also present on the console shell to toggle the 8-bit sound effects.
