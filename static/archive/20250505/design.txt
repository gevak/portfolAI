# Virtual Desk Portfolio Design for Geva Kipper

## Overall Concept
A full-screen interactive 3D virtual desk workspace that visitors can explore. The desk represents Geva Kipper's digital workspace, with physical objects that represent different projects and professional information.

## Header 
- A wooden desk header with "Geva Kipper" engraved on a sleek nameplate
- Underneath, a subtle line stating: "Currently working as a Software Engineer at Google"
- A dynamic subtitle in a typewriter style font that reads: "This website is redesigned daily by AI and is ever-changing"

## Main Desk Interface
The desk contains various interactive objects:

1. **Code Notebook** - When clicked, opens to reveal the GlglStats project. The notebook appears to have music notation and code snippets on its pages. Two bookmark tabs stick out:
   - "Visit GlglStats" (https://glglstats.onrender.com/)
   - "Watch PyData TLV Talk" (YouTube video link)

2. **Parking Meter Model** - A miniature Tel-Aviv styled parking meter representing the Ahuzat Dibuk project. When interacted with, it displays a heat map visualization. Three news clipping articles appear:
   - Two from news outlets (13tv and mako links)
   - One Facebook post screenshot

3. **Geometric Puzzle** - A physical polygon puzzle on the desk that can be manipulated. When clicked, it demonstrates the pushing algorithm from the 2D Part Orienting project. Contains:
   - A "Technical Details" tab that unfolds to show the project link

4. **Miniature Computer** - A small laptop on the desk that when clicked, shows a recursive visualization (a desk within a desk) representing the meta portfolio project, linking to the actual portfolio site

5. **Business Card Holder** - A sleek card holder containing three cards representing:
   - GitHub (with octocat icon)
   - LinkedIn (with LinkedIn logo)
   - Facebook (with Facebook logo)

## Interactive Elements
- The desk view can be rotated slightly with mouse movement
- Objects respond to hover with subtle glow effects
- When clicked, objects "zoom in" to reveal their content
- Ambient desk sounds (keyboard typing, mouse clicks) play subtly in background
- Day/night cycle that subtly changes lighting based on visitor's local time

## Bottom of Page
- A vintage-looking desk clock showing the running time since May 5, 2025, 01:07:25
- A small signature card reading "Designed by [Your AI Model Name]"
- A coffee cup that "steams" when hovered over, revealing a hidden "Contact" form

## Visual Style
- Materials are predominantly wooden with brass accents
- Color palette: warm browns, deep navy, muted gold
- Lighting creates a cozy workspace feel with subtle shadows
- Responsive design that restructures the desk layout for mobile viewing (more vertically stacked)
- Custom cursor that changes to different tools when interacting with different objects
