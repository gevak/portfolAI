# Escape Room Portfolio – Design Specification

## Overall Concept & Atmosphere

The page opens with a dark, atmospheric environment inspired by a dimly-lit escape room. The background is a deep charcoal-black with a subtle animated texture resembling concrete walls, overlaid with faintly glowing circuit-board trace patterns that pulse slowly in muted cyan and amber. A slight vignette darkens the edges of the viewport, creating a sense of enclosure. The entire page uses a monospaced primary font (like JetBrains Mono or Fira Code) for headings and code elements, paired with a clean sans-serif (Inter or DM Sans) for body text. The color palette centers on deep blacks and dark grays, with accent colors of electric cyan, warm amber, and a subtle red for locked states.

## Header & Introduction

At the very top, centered, the name **Geva Kipper** appears in large, bold monospaced letters. Each letter initially renders as a scrambled/randomized character (like a decryption effect) and then resolves into the correct letter one by one, left to right, as if being decoded. Below the name, a single clean line reads his role at Google in the sans-serif font, fading in after the name animation completes. Beneath that, a smaller italic subtitle in a muted gray with a gentle pulsing glow reads the explanation that this website is redesigned each day by AI and is ever-changing. Next to this subtitle, a tiny animated icon of a rotating refresh/cycle symbol reinforces the concept.

## The Puzzle Mechanism & Lock Interface

Below the header, a short instructional line appears styled as a terminal prompt (with a blinking cursor): something like a cryptic hint inviting visitors to "unlock" each room. However — and this is critical to the design — all six project boxes are actually **always visible and fully readable**. The "escape room" theme is purely aesthetic and atmospheric, not a functional gate. Each box simply *appears* as though it has been freshly unlocked, using visual styling to evoke that feeling.

## The Six Project Boxes – Layout

The six project boxes are arranged in a **3×2 grid** on desktop, collapsing to a single column on mobile. Each box is designed to look like a **heavy steel door or vault panel** that is permanently in its "open/unlocked" state. Each panel has a thin border with a subtle metallic gradient (dark steel gray to lighter silver), rounded corners, and a very faint inner glow in cyan along the edges suggesting it is powered/active. At the top-left corner of each panel, a small icon of an **open padlock** in green/cyan glows softly, indicating the section is unlocked. Each box has a unique small puzzle-themed icon or symbol etched into the top-right corner (a key, a gear, a magnifying glass, a lightbulb, a circuit node, a recursive spiral) rendered as thin-line SVG illustrations in amber.

When a user **hovers** over a box, the panel lifts slightly (translateY and a stronger box-shadow), the border glow intensifies, and a faint ambient sound-like visual ripple emanates from the cursor position (a radial gradient flash). The interior of each box has a very dark semi-transparent background so text is crisp against it.

## Box 1 – GlglStats

The box title "GlglStats" is displayed in a stylized header with a small animated waveform icon beside it (a few bars rising and falling like an audio equalizer, looping). Below the title, a concise description of the project — measuring repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression and visualizing repetition patterns. The description text is clean and left-aligned. Below the text, two call-to-action elements appear: a button styled as a glowing cyan terminal command (like `> Visit Site`) linking to glglstats.geekip.dev, and beside it an embedded YouTube thumbnail for the PyData TLV talk, styled with rounded corners and a semi-transparent play button overlay. The thumbnail links out to the YouTube video. A thin horizontal line in a gradient from cyan to transparent separates the description from the links.

## Box 2 – Ahuzat Dibuk

The title "Ahuzat Dibuk" appears with a small animated icon of a car parking symbol that periodically flashes between red (full) and green (available). The description explains the Python scraping and data visualization project for Tel-Aviv parking lot occupancy and heatmap generation. Below the description, the links are organized as a small list with labels: "In the News" with the two news links (13tv and mako) displayed as compact pill-shaped buttons with a small newspaper icon, and "Original Post" with the Facebook link styled similarly but with a subtle Facebook-blue accent. Each pill has a hover effect that brightens it.

## Box 3 – 2D Part Orienting

The title "2D Part Orienting" is accompanied by a small animated SVG of a simple polygon (like a pentagon) being slowly rotated and pushed by a tiny animated line/fence, illustrating the concept of part orienting. The animation loops smoothly and subtly. The description covers the C++ implementation in a computational geometry library for constructing push plans. A single link button leads to the CGAL project page, styled as a code-block button with angle brackets: `< View Project & Code >`.

## Box 4 – The Turing Jest

The title "The Turing Jest" is displayed with a small theater masks icon (comedy/tragedy) where the comedy mask subtly winks on a loop. The description explains the LMSYS-style arena where LLMs compete at puns, rated by users. A link button styled with a playful font weight and a jester-hat micro-icon leads to jest.geekip.dev. The border accent on this particular box leans slightly more amber/gold than the others, giving it a warmer, more playful feel.

## Box 5 – Rhymes of Israel

The title "Rhymes of Israel" appears with a small Chrome browser icon next to it. The description explains the Chrome extension using an LLM to rewrite Israeli news headlines into comedic rhymes. Below, a button styled to resemble the Chrome Web Store install button (with a small download arrow icon) links to the extension page. The text in this box has a slightly whimsical quality — perhaps the description itself is rendered in a subtle italic to echo the poetic nature of the project.

## Box 6 – This Portfolio (Meta)

The title reads something like "This Very Site" or "Portfolio Inception" with a small recursive/fractal icon — a square within a square within a square, drawn in thin cyan lines. The description explains this is the portfolio website itself, redesigned daily by AI. The link to geekip.dev is styled as a self-referential loop arrow icon with the URL. This box has a unique visual touch: its metallic border has a faint animated dashed-line pattern flowing clockwise around the perimeter, like data flowing in a loop, reinforcing the meta/recursive concept.

## Box 7 – Connect / Social Links

This final box is styled slightly differently — instead of a vault door, it looks like a **keyring or key rack**. Three large, clickable icons are displayed side by side, each shaped like a key or hanging from a small hook illustration. The GitHub icon (Octocat silhouette), LinkedIn icon (in-logo), and Facebook icon (f-logo) are rendered as embossed metallic badges in their respective brand colors but desaturated to fit the dark theme, brightening to full color on hover. Below each icon, the handle/username is written in small monospaced text. The icons have a gentle swing animation on page load, as if they were just hung on the rack.

## Ambient Details & Decorative Elements

Scattered very faintly across the background (behind the grid), there are barely visible decorative elements: a faded keyhole shape here, a cipher wheel there, a few lines of pseudo-code or binary strings scrolling very slowly upward like Matrix rain but extremely subtle and in very low opacity (5-8%). These never interfere with readability but add depth and atmosphere when noticed. Occasionally, a small particle (like a floating dust mote or spark) drifts across the viewport in a very slow, random path, colored in dim amber.

## Scroll Behavior

Since it is a single page, as the user scrolls down, each row of boxes has a staggered entrance animation — they slide in slightly from below with a fade, one box triggering just before the other in its row, accompanied by a subtle CSS transition that mimics a "click-unlock" (a brief scale pulse from 0.97 to 1.0). The padlock icon on each box plays a tiny rotation animation as it enters the viewport for the first time.

## Footer

At the very bottom of the page, separated by a thin horizontal rule in a fading cyan gradient, the footer sits on the same dark background. On the left side (or centered on mobile), a credit line reads the AI model's name and a brief acknowledgment of generating the design, styled in small, elegant, muted text. On the right side (or below on mobile), the **stopwatch** is displayed in a monospaced font styled to look like an LED/digital clock readout — glowing cyan digits on a slightly darker recessed panel with a faint inner shadow. It shows the elapsed time since 2026-02-15 01:44:38 in the format `XXXXd HHh MMm SSs`, updating the seconds in real-time with a smooth CSS transition (a very brief fade/tick effect on digit change rather than a hard swap). Above the clock, a tiny label reads "Time since creation" in small caps.

## Responsive Behavior

On tablet, the grid shifts to 2 columns with the social-links box spanning full width at the bottom. On mobile, everything stacks into a single column. The vault-door panels stretch to full width with slightly reduced padding. The header name animation still plays but faster. The background ambient elements are reduced in quantity for performance. All interactive hover effects become tap-activated or are replaced with persistent subtle glows.

## Typography & Spacing

Generous padding inside each box (around 28-36px). Line heights are comfortable (1.6-1.7 for body text). Project titles are sized at roughly 1.4rem, bold, in the monospaced font. Descriptions are 0.95rem in the sans-serif. Links and buttons are clearly distinguishable with underline-on-hover or glow-on-hover treatments. The overall page has comfortable vertical spacing between sections — it should feel spacious and breathable despite the enclosed escape-room theme.
