Design a single-page “Stats / Skills / Quests” portfolio that feels like an elegant RPG dashboard crossed with a live analytics console. The overall aesthetic is dark, minimal, and premium (near-black background with subtle grain), accented with one “signal” color that shifts daily (e.g., teal → violet → amber) to support the subtitle about AI redesigning the site each day. Typography is modern and technical: a clean sans-serif for body text, paired with a slightly monospaced UI font for labels, stats, and microcopy. Use soft glassy panels, thin 1px borders, and gentle shadowing—more “instrument panel” than “neon cyberpunk.”

At the top, a hero header that reads like a character sheet: **Geva Kipper** as the title, with a compact single sentence beneath: “Software engineer at Google, building and scaling data-driven systems.” Under that, a subtitle in smaller italic or lighter weight: “This portfolio is re-designed each day by AI—so the layout, colors, and micro-interactions are ever-changing.” Add a slim “daily seed” badge (e.g., “AI Seed: 2025-12-24”) and a tiny animated “re-render” indicator that subtly pulses, reinforcing the living-site concept without being distracting.

Directly under the hero, place a horizontal “Stat Bar” strip: three or four compact gauges labeled **Stats**, **Skills**, **Quests**, and **Reputation**. These aren’t literal metrics but styled as playful UI components (progress bars, radial dials, tiny sparklines) that animate into place on load. Each gauge acts as a filter for the sections below (e.g., toggling highlights: “Stats” emphasizes data projects; “Skills” emphasizes languages/tools; “Quests” emphasizes project narratives). Keep interactions subtle: hover reveals tooltips like “Compression, scraping, visualization, geometry, LLM products.”

The main content is a grid of **seven** “Quest Cards” (even if called “six boxes/sections,” treat the projects + social as discrete cards; if a strict count is required, merge the self-reference into the footer). Arrange them in a responsive two-column layout on desktop, one column on mobile. Each card has a consistent internal structure but distinct “quest flavor” via iconography and a mini visualization unique to the project. Every card includes: a quest title, short one-liner description, a “Tags / Skills” row (small pill badges), and two CTA buttons (e.g., “Open,” “Watch,” “Read,” “Install”). Use an elegant reveal animation (fade + slight rise) with staggered timing. On hover, a card “tilts” by 1–2 degrees and shows a faint animated gridline overlay like a scanning HUD.

1) **GlglStats** card: Title “GlglStats” with a small “LZ77” emblem. The mini visualization is a stylized “repetition fingerprint” strip—thin vertical bars that cluster to suggest recurring motifs. Description: “Python project measuring repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression, plus visualizations of repetition patterns across famous tracks.” Include two prominent links: **https://glglstats.geekip.dev** (primary) and the PyData TLV talk **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo** (secondary with a play icon). If embedding is allowed, show a small muted video thumbnail panel that expands in-place when clicked; otherwise, show a clean poster frame linking out.

2) **Ahuzat Dibuk** card: Feels like an urban operations map. Mini visualization: a small heat-map tile (abstracted, not literal Tel-Aviv map) with animated “occupancy pulses.” Description: “Python scraping + data visualization project collecting occupancy statistics for Tel-Aviv parking lots, generating heat-maps for residents.” Add three links as a neat “Press & Source” stack with small publication icons:  
- https://13tv.co.il/item/news/domestic/internal/parking-902956407/  
- https://www.mako.co.il/nexter-news/Article-ae43964b891bf71027.htm  
- https://www.facebook.com/groups/secrettelaviv/posts/10159636301195943/  
Make the “Press” links look like clippings: thin bordered chips with a subtle paper texture, still consistent with the dark theme.

3) **2D Part Orienting** card: This one is crisp and mathematical. Mini visualization: a polygon outline with a few animated arrows showing “push plan” steps (looping slowly). Description: “C++ implementation in an open-source computational geometry library of an efficient algorithm that constructs a push plan to orient a given polygon.” Add a single clear CTA to **https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/**. The tags row should emphasize **C++**, **Computational Geometry**, **Algorithms**.

4) **The Turing Jest** card: Lighter, playful tone but still elegant. Mini visualization: a tiny “arena bracket” or two chat bubbles exchanging a pun, with a star rating animation that fills on hover. Description: “An LMSYS-like arena where LLMs compete at making and explaining puns; users rate the responses.” Link button: **https://jest.geekip.dev**. Use microcopy like “Enter the Arena” instead of “View,” and a small “crowd meter” sparkline that animates faintly.

5) **Rhymes of Israel** card: Mini visualization: a headline transforms into a rhyming couplet—text morph animation that cycles between “News Headline” → “Yearbook Rhyme.” Description: “Chrome extension using an LLM to rewrite Israeli news headlines into comedic rhymes in the style of a highschool yearbook.” Add a strong install CTA: **https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eainginjgdkpgolpjniijdihfbeeeklb**. The card’s accent could be slightly warmer than others (still within the daily palette) to feel editorial and humorous.

6) **Portfolio Website (Meta Quest)** card: Make this card self-aware. Mini visualization: a wireframe thumbnail that subtly “rearranges” itself every few seconds (tiny layout shuffle) to echo the AI redesign concept. Description: “A living single-page portfolio that changes daily—stats, skills, and quests as an evolving UI.” Add the self-reference link: **https://geekip.dev**. Include a small “Changelog” micro-panel that shows one rotating line like “Today’s variation: Card order + accent palette.”

7) **Links / Social** card: Designed like a “Guild Contacts” panel. Three large, clean buttons with icons and short labels (GitHub, LinkedIn, Facebook), plus the raw URLs beneath in smaller monospace for clarity:  
- github.com/gevak  
- linkedin.com/in/gevakip  
- facebook.com/geva.kipper  
This card can include a subtle “presence” indicator dot next to each platform, purely decorative.

At the bottom, a slim footer bar separated by a faint divider line. Left side: “Created by ChatGPT (OpenAI) on 2025-12-24” (or similar wording) as the required AI credit. Right side: a live-running stopwatch labeled “Time since 2025-12-24 01:09:38” showing **HH:MM:SS**, updating every second. Style the stopwatch like a precise instrument readout (monospace digits, slightly brighter than surrounding text). Keep the footer understated but crisp, so it feels like the final line of a well-designed dashboard.

Overall motion language: restrained and purposeful—cards glide in, gauges fill, tiny visualizations loop slowly. The “ever-changing AI redesign” is expressed via daily palette shifts, slight reordering of cards, alternate micro-illustrations inside cards, and swapping one of a few layout templates (same content, different composition) while preserving readability and elegance.
