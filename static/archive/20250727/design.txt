### Overall Aesthetic & Atmosphere

The website boots up, not loads. On first visit, the screen is black, followed by a rapid, simulated BIOS sequence. Text flashes by—`MEMORY CHECK... OK`, `VIRTUAL CORE INIT... OK`, `RENDERING KERNEL...`—before a large, stylized ASCII art logo of the initials "GK" glitches into the center and fades. The entire page then materializes with a CRT scan-line overlay and a subtle, dark background featuring a faint, animated grid pattern, reminiscent of a tactical map.

The color palette is a modern take on the classic monochrome terminal: a deep, near-black charcoal background (`#0D1117`), with primary text in a sharp, luminous cyan (`#00E5E5`). Accents for links and interactive elements are a vibrant "warning" yellow (`#FFD700`). The typography is exclusively a crisp, monospaced font like 'Fira Code' to enhance the code-terminal feel, with ligatures enabled. All animations are sharp and digital, avoiding soft fades in favor of typewriter effects, glitches, and quick, precise movements. Sound effects are used sparingly: a soft key-click on interaction and a subtle hum for the background ambiance.

### Header Section

At the top, the name **GEVA KIPPER** appears with a typewriter effect, a blinking cursor at the end. Below it, a line of code-comment style text:
`// Software Engineer @ Google, orchestrating large-scale data systems.`

Directly underneath, a "system status" line serves as the subtitle, its color cycling slowly between cyan and yellow:
`[STATUS: ONLINE] [UI HASH: 7a9f..c2e1] [AI-DRIVEN DAILY REDESIGN SEQUENCE COMPLETE]`

### Project & Contact Modules

The main content is a responsive grid of seven rectangular modules, or "data panels." Each panel has a distinct border and a title bar like a terminal window, e.g., `[[ MODULE: GlglStats ]]`, with a perpetually blinking underscore `_` at the end of the title. Hovering over a panel causes its border to glow brighter and a faint electrical crackle animation to trace its edges.

**1. Module: GlglStats**
Title: `[[ MODULE: GlglStats.py ]]`
A central, animated ASCII art visualization depicts a sine wave compressing and decompressing, representing the Lempel-Ziv algorithm.
Description:
`> Python project measuring Israeli pop-chart repetitiveness via LZ77 compression.`
`> Renders visual fingerprints of song repetition patterns.`

**2. Module: Ahuzat Dibuk**
Title: `[[ MODULE: Ahuzat_Dibuk_Scraper ]]`
The visual is a simplified Tel-Aviv map grid where different character blocks (`░`, `▒`, `▓`, `█`) pulse in yellow and red, simulating a live heatmap.
Description:
`> Python scraping & data-vis project analyzing Tel-Aviv parking occupancy.`
`> Generates live heat-maps to assist residents in finding parking.`

**3. Module: 2D Part Orienting**
Title: `[[ MODULE: CGL_Push_Plan.cpp ]]`
An animation shows the wireframe outline of a polygon, rendered in ASCII characters, being "pushed" by lines from the edges until it settles into a stable orientation.
Description:
`> C++ implementation of an efficient algorithm for orienting polygons.`
`> Contribution to an open-source computational geometry library (CGAL).`

**4. Module: The Turing Jest**
Title: `[[ MODULE: The_Turing_Jest.llm ]]`
The visual is a simple ASCII art icon of a human brain facing a microchip, with binary code (`0101`) flowing between them.
Description:
`> LLM arena for competitive pun generation and explanation.`
`> Crowdsourced user ratings determine the wittiest AI.`

**5. Module: Rhymes of Israel**
Title: `[[ MODULE: RhymesOfIsrael.ext ]]`
An ASCII art newspaper icon morphs into a rhyming couplet that changes on each page load (e.g., "The news today, some might say / Is better read in a funnier way").
Description:
`> Chrome extension leveraging an LLM to rewrite Israeli news headlines.`
`> Transforms current events into comedic, high-school-yearbook-style rhymes.`
Interactive Links:

**6. Module: Meta Portfolio**
Title: `[[ MODULE: Project_Recursion ]]`
The visual is a smaller, simplified, non-interactive wireframe of the portfolio's own layout, creating an infinity mirror effect.
Description:
`> This website. A single-page, sci-fi hacker-themed portfolio.`
`> Designed to be ephemeral, with a new UI variant ostensibly generated daily by an AI.`
Interactive Links:
`[view_source_loop] - https://geekip.dev`

**7. Module: System Connect**
Title: `[[ MODULE: Contact_Protocols ]]`
This panel contains only three distinct, stylized ASCII art logos for GitHub (Octocat), LinkedIn (in), and Facebook (f).
Description:
`> Establishing connection to external networks.`
Interactive Links (next to each logo):
`[GitHub] - github.com/gevak`
`[LinkedIn] - linkedin.com/in/gevakip`
`[Facebook] - facebook.com/geva.kipper`

### Footer

The footer is a single, fixed line at the very bottom of the viewport, separated by a thin, glowing horizontal rule.
`UI DESIGN SEQUENCE GENERATED BY [GPT-4] :: SYSTEM CLOCK SINCE 2025-07-27 01:19:58 :: UPTIME: [XXh : XXm : XXs]`
The `[XXh : XXm : XXs]` is a live stopwatch, continuously counting up in hours, minutes, and seconds from the specified timestamp.
