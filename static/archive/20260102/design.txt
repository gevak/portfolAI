**Visual concept: The "Temporal Terminal"**

**General Aesthetic & Layout:**
The website mirrors a high-end, futuristic command-line interface (CLI) or a sophisticated text-adventure game log (similar to Zork meets The Matrix, but with modern UI polish). The background is deep obsidian, barely distinguishable from black. The typography is exclusively monospaced (e.g., Fira Code or JetBrains Mono). Text colors should be primarily off-white for the narrative, with interactive elements in neon cyan and muted gold. The layout is a single vertical scroll, resembling a continuous printout of a system log or a playthrough session.

**Header: The "Player Stats"**
At the very top, treat the developer’s identity as the RPG character profile.
*   **Character Name:** "Geva Kipper" displayed in large, ASCII-inspired block text or a glitch-effect heavy font.
*   **Current Status:** A status bar underneath the name reads: "Class: Software Engineer | Guild: Google | Status: Active."
*   **System Message (Subtitle):** Just below the status bar, display the disclaimer in a dim, blinking distinct color (like terminal green): `>> SYSTEM NOTICE: This interface is procedurally re-generated daily by Artificial Intelligence. The landscape is ever-changing.`

**The Body: The "Quest Log" (The 6 Boxes)**
The main content is not displayed as standard grid cards, but as "narrative decision points." Each of the six "boxes" is styled as a distinct block of command-line text, separated by a dashed line divider (`-------------------`). Each block follows a specific format:
1.  **The Prompt:** A narrative sentence describing a problem (The "Adventure").
2.  **The Choice:** A command that the user "executed" (The Project Title).
3.  **The Result:** The description of the project and the links.

*   **Box 1 (GlglStats):**
    *   *Narrative:* "You encounter a chaotic stream of repetitive pop music frequencies. You need to identify patterns using compression algorithms."
    *   *Command:* `> EXECUTE PROTOCOL: GlglStats`
    *   *Output:* Display a mini-visualization of an audio waveform. Text description details the Python implementation and LZ77 compression.
    *   *Action Items:* Two bracketed buttons `[ACCESS SITE]` and `[WATCH PYDATA PRESENTATION]`.

*   **Box 2 (Ahuzat Dibuk):**
    *   *Narrative:* "You are navigating the urban labyrinth of Tel-Aviv. Residents are desperate for intelligence on parking availability."
    *   *Command:* `> DEPLOY SCRAPER: Ahuzat Dibuk`
    *   *Output:* A subtle background processing animation of a heatmap. Text explains the data visualization and scraper.
    *   *Action Items:* Links formatted as `[READ NEWS: CHANNEL 13]`, `[READ NEWS: MAKO]`, and `[ACCESS ARCHIVE: FACEBOOK]`.

*   **Box 3 (2D Part Orienting):**
    *   *Narrative:* "A geometric anomaly blocks your path. You must write an algorithm to construct a push plan to orient the polygon."
    *   *Command:* `> COMPILE C++: 2D Part Orienting`
    *   *Output:* A small SVG animation of a polygon rotating or aligning. Text details the C++ implementation and open-source library contribution.
    *   *Action Items:* One link styled as `[INSPECT SOURCE CODE]`.

*   **Box 4 (The Turing Jest):**
    *   *Narrative:* "You enter the Arena of Wits. Generative entities are battling to create the ultimate pun. You must adjudicate."
    *   *Command:* `> ENTER ARENA: The Turing Jest`
    *   *Output:* Text describes the LMSYS-style battle and user rating system.
    *   *Action Items:* `[JOIN THE BATTLE]` (Link to site).

*   **Box 5 (Rhymes of Israel):**
    *   *Narrative:* "The headlines are too depressing. You decide to cast a spell to rewrite reality into a high-school yearbook aesthetic."
    *   *Command:* `> INSTALL MOD: Rhymes of Israel`
    *   *Output:* Description of the Chrome extension and the comedic LLM rewriting mechanism.
    *   *Action Items:* A prominent button `[ADD TO CHROME]`.

*   **Box 6 (Portfolio - Meta):**
    *   *Narrative:* "You look into the digital mirror. You see... yourself, looking at a website, looking at yourself."
    *   *Command:* `> RECURSION CHECK: geekip.dev`
    *   *Output:* "A website built to showcase the website you are currently viewing."
    *   *Action Items:* A link labeled `[INFINITE LOOP]` pointing to the current URL.

**Social Footer: The "Comms Array"**
Following the quest log, a section labeled `>> ESTABLISH COMMINICATIONS` displays the contact links. Instead of icons, use ASCII representations of loops or nodes followed by text links:
*   `[GITHUB::gevak]`
*   `[LINKEDIN::gevakip]`
*   `[FACEBOOK::geva.kipper]`

**The Footer: "Temporal Anomaly"**
The absolute bottom of the page features a "sticky" element or a footer block.
*   **Design:** It looks like a system diagnostic panel.
*   **Credit:** "Architect: Generative AI Model [Your Model Name]."
*   **The Stopwatch:** Since the requested date (2026-01-02) is in the future, style this as a "Time Until Event" or a "Temporal Displacement" counter. Displays a precise, ticking digital clock (HH:MM:SS) showing the delta between *now* and the future date 2026-01-02 01:12:25. If the result is negative (time travel theme), display the numbers in red; if positive (countdown), display in amber. Label it: `T-MINUS SYSTEM RESET`.
