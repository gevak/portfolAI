Design the page as a single-screen “interactive storybook” that unfolds vertically: a hero “cover” at the top, a branching narrative map in the middle, and the project “chapters” as elegant cards that can be reached via choices (without navigating away). The hero section reads like the opening of a choose‑your‑own‑adventure: **“Geva Kipper”** as the title, followed by one crisp line about his current role (e.g., “Software engineer at Google, building and refining large-scale systems that turn complex data into reliable products.”). Directly beneath, a smaller subtitle states: **“This portfolio is re-designed each day by AI—ever-changing by design.”** Add a subtle “daily remix” badge with a tasteful shimmer (not flashy) to reinforce the living-site concept.

Below the hero, place a “Decision Compass” UI: a clean, minimal branching diagram (nodes connected by thin lines) that represents career paths—**Data & Visualization**, **Algorithms & Geometry**, **LLMs & Play**, **Civic Tech**, **Meta / Web Craft**. Clicking a node animates the page to the relevant chapter card, while also highlighting that path in the diagram and dimming unrelated branches. Each decision ends in one of several “ending panels” (still on the same page) that summarize the viewer’s chosen arc (e.g., “You reached: The Data Storyteller” / “The Geometry Tactician” / “The LLM Ringmaster”), with a one-paragraph takeaway and a button to “Restart your adventure” that re-centers the branching map. This creates real endings without leaving the single page: the story is about how the visitor chooses to interpret the portfolio.

The project content is presented as **seven** consistent “chapter cards” (visually like premium book pages or museum placards): rounded rectangles, generous whitespace, a restrained typographic hierarchy, and a thin accent color that can change with the daily AI theme. Each card has a “front” (short narrative hook + tags + a “Choose this chapter” button) and a “back” (details + links/media). Flipping/expanding is animated with modern, subtle transforms; on mobile, it becomes an accordion expansion. Every card also shows a tiny “chapter choice” prompt at the bottom (two small buttons) that routes the visitor to a next recommended chapter, keeping the branching story alive even while scrolling linearly.

Cards/sections (with the required content embedded and clearly labeled):
1) **GlglStats** — Present as the “music-data chapter.” Describe: “Python project measuring repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression, plus visualizations of repetition patterns across famous songs.” Include a prominent button link: **https://glglstats.geekip.dev** and an embedded video panel (or large thumbnail that opens a lightbox) for: **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo** (caption: “PyData TLV talk”).  
2) **Ahuzat Dibuk** — “civic scraping chapter.” Describe: “Python scraping + data visualization project tracking Tel-Aviv parking lot occupancy and generating resident-friendly heat maps.” Provide three clearly separated press/publication links: **https://13tv.co.il/item/news/domestic/internal/parking-902956407/**, **https://www.mako.co.il/nexter-news/Article-ae43964b891bf71027.htm**, and the original Facebook post: **https://www.facebook.com/groups/secrettelaviv/posts/10159636301195943/**.  
3) **2D Part Orienting** — “geometry/algorithms chapter.” Describe: “C++ implementation in an open-source computational geometry library of an efficient algorithm constructing a push plan to orient a polygon.” Link: **https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/**.  
4) **The Turing Jest** — “LLM arena chapter.” Describe: “An LMSYS-like arena where LLMs compete at making and explaining puns, with user ratings.” Link: **https://jest.geekip.dev**.  
5) **Rhymes of Israel** — “browser mischief chapter.” Describe: “Chrome extension using an LLM to rewrite Israeli news headlines into comedic rhymes in the style of a highschool yearbook.” Link: **https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eainginjgdkpgolpjniijdihfbeeeklb**.  
6) **Portfolio Website (Meta)** — “the self-referential chapter.” Frame it as the story acknowledging itself: “A portfolio site about building a portfolio site—crafted as an adventure with multiple endings.” Include a self-reference link: **https://geekip.dev**.  
7) **Links / Contact** — A final, clean card styled like an “epilogue.” Large, simple icon+text links in a single row on desktop (stacked on mobile): **github.com/gevak**, **linkedin.com/in/gevakip**, **facebook.com/geva.kipper**. Include a short line inviting collaboration and an option to “jump to an ending” (quick links to the ending panels) for visitors who prefer shortcuts.

Finish with a refined footer that feels like the book’s colophon: a small credit line reading “Created by ChatGPT (OpenAI)” (or equivalent phrasing) plus a prominent but tasteful **stopwatch** labeled “Time since 2025-12-13 01:05:54” showing **HH:MM:SS** ticking live. Visually, place the stopwatch in a thin bordered capsule with monospaced digits, aligned to the right on desktop and centered on mobile, reinforcing the “living narrative” theme while staying elegant and unobtrusive.
