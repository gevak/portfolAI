**Retro Desktop Portfolio Design**

The website mimics a classic late 80s/early 90s computer desktop with a dark charcoal background featuring a subtle pixel grid pattern. The entire interface uses a monospace font (Courier New or similar) with green phosphor-style text (#00FF41) reminiscent of old CRT monitors, with slight text glow effects for authenticity.

**Header Section**
At the top left, display "GEVA KIPPER" in large ASCII art-style lettering, followed below by a blinking cursor and the tagline "Software Engineer @ Google, building systems that scale beyond imagination." Directly underneath, in smaller italicized text: "This portfolio is redesigned daily by AI • Always evolving, never static"

**Desktop Interface**
The main content area resembles a file manager window with a classic beveled border frame. Five folder icons are arranged in a 2x3 grid layout, each designed as pixelated folder graphics in classic beige/yellow tones. When hovering over folders, they highlight with a blue selection rectangle and display a tooltip with the project name.

**Folder Interactions**
Clicking a folder triggers a vintage "double-click" animation and opens a modal window styled like a classic dialog box with the characteristic raised border. Each project window contains:

1. **GlglStats Folder**: Contains an icon resembling a music note, displays project description in terminal-style text blocks, with the website link styled as a clickable file icon and the YouTube video embedded in a retro media player interface.

2. **Ahuzat Dibuk Folder**: Features a parking meter pixel icon, shows heatmap visualizations as if they're image files in the folder, with news links presented as newspaper-style file icons.

3. **2D Part Orienting Folder**: Displays geometric shape icons, presents the C++ information in a code editor-style window with syntax highlighting, and the project link as a folder shortcut.

4. **Portfolio Meta Folder**: Recursively shows a miniature version of the desktop itself as the folder contents, with the self-reference link styled as a mirror or recursive icon.

5. **Social Links Folder**: Contains three distinct retro-style application icons (a cat for GitHub, a briefcase for LinkedIn, a letter 'f' for Facebook) that open the respective social media profiles.

**Footer Elements**
At the bottom right corner, position a small status bar showing "AI Designer: Claude • Session Active" alongside a digital stopwatch displaying elapsed time since 2025-05-30 01:06:00 in HH:MM:SS format, updating in real-time. The footer uses a slightly darker background strip to separate it from the main desktop area.

**Interactive Details**
Add subtle scanline effects across the entire screen, occasional screen "flicker" animations, and retro sound effects (optional) for clicks and folder operations. All text maintains consistent spacing and alignment typical of early computer interfaces, with sharp pixelated edges and no anti-aliasing to enhance the vintage aesthetic.
