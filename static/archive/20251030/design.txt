# Code Archaeology Portfolio - Design Specification

## Overall Visual Concept

The page presents as an archaeological dig site viewed from above, with a rich, earthy color palette of terracotta (#C7715E), sandstone (#E8D4B8), aged parchment (#F5EFE0), and deep soil browns (#4A3728). The background features a subtle texture resembling layered sediment or stratified rock, evoking geological time layers. Each project box appears as an excavation grid square marked with archaeological string grids, resembling those used in real digs.

## Header Section

At the top, "GEVA KIPPER" appears in a bold, monospaced serif font reminiscent of typewriter text on archaeological field notes, colored in deep brown ink. Directly beneath, a single line in italics states his current Google work. Below that, a subtitle in a lighter, slightly antiqued font reads about the AI-redesigned nature of the site, with a subtle animation making it appear as if dust is being brushed away to reveal the text.

## The Excavation Grid

The six project boxes are arranged in a 2Ã—3 asymmetrical grid that appears slightly irregular, as if each excavation square was dug at different times. Each box has a raised border effect with corner stakes and string grid overlays drawn in thin, sepia-toned lines. The boxes have subtle drop shadows suggesting depth into the earth.

## Individual Project Presentations

Each project box features a small "artifact tag" hanging from the top-left corner (like museum specimen tags) displaying the project number. The project name appears as if carved or embossed into a stone tablet fragment positioned at the top of each box. 

**Box 1 (GlglStats)**: Contains a subtle background pattern of compression algorithms visualized as ancient cuneiform-like symbols. The YouTube video embeds as a worn photograph pinned with a corner marker. The link appears as a brushed-away section revealing text beneath.

**Box 2 (Ahuzat Dibuk)**: Features a faint heat-map overlay bleeding through from behind like uncovered frescoes. The multiple news links appear as yellowed newspaper clippings partially buried, with corners curling.

**Box 3 (2D Part Orienting)**: Displays geometric shapes as if they're pottery shards or architectural fragments. The C++ code reference appears etched into the background like ancient engineering diagrams.

**Box 4 (The Turing Jest)**: This box has a slightly more playful appearance, with the LLM arena concept represented by two opposing artifacts. Comic-style speech bubbles emerge from the background like uncovered graffiti.

**Box 5 (Rhymes of Israel)**: Chrome extension icon appears as a discovered amulet or seal. Hebrew text fragments float in the background like ancient scroll fragments.

**Box 6 (Portfolio Meta)**: This box appears as a polished mirror or reflective surface among the archaeological finds, creating a recursive visual effect. The border glows subtly as if this artifact is still being formed.

**Box 7 (Social Links)**: Presented as three carved stone tablets or seals, each bearing the respective platform's icon rendered in a primitive, archaeological style. They're arranged horizontally with subtle hover effects that make them appear to rise from the dig site.

## Interactive Elements

When hovering over any project box, a gentle "dust brush" animation sweeps across, revealing slightly more vibrant colors beneath, as if you're actively excavating. Clicking triggers a subtle "dirt falling away" particle effect. All links glow with an aged amber color on hover, like candlelight on parchment.

## Footer

The bottom contains two elements aligned to opposite sides. On the left, in small, elegant script: "Excavated and reconstructed by [AI Model Name] - Autonomous Archaeological AI, 2025". On the right, a brass-effect stopwatch graphic displays the elapsed time since October 30, 2025, with ticking seconds creating a gentle animation. The stopwatch appears weathered and antique, fitting the archaeological theme.

## Typography & Motion

All text uses a combination of a sturdy slab serif for headings (suggesting carved stone) and a clean, readable sans-serif for body text (representing modern archaeological documentation). Smooth scroll-triggered animations reveal each box as you dig deeper down the page, with a subtle parallax effect making the sediment background shift at different speeds from the content, enhancing the depth perception.
