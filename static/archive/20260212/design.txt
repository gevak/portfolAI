# Dream Portfolio — Design Description

## Overall Atmosphere & Color Palette

The entire page sits against a deep, dark gradient background that shifts from midnight indigo (#0a0a2e) at the top to a hazy dark violet-black (#120824) at the bottom, evoking a vast, infinite dream sky. Scattered across this background are hundreds of tiny, softly glowing dots — some white, some pale lavender, some warm gold — that drift very slowly in random directions, like dust motes in moonlight or distant stars in a subconscious sky. Occasionally, a faint nebula-like smudge of translucent color (soft pink, pale teal, muted gold) appears as a large radial gradient blob, slowly pulsing in opacity, giving the feeling of gaseous clouds drifting through a dreamscape. The entire page uses a parallax depth system with at least four layers: the far background particles move the slowest on scroll, the nebula blobs move slightly faster, the content cards move at normal scroll speed, and small decorative floating elements (described below) move faster, creating a strong sense of three-dimensional depth as the user scrolls.

## Floating Decorative Elements

Distributed throughout the page, between and around the content sections, are surreal floating objects rendered as semi-transparent SVG illustrations or CSS-drawn shapes with soft glowing edges. These include: a giant translucent clock face with no hands (melting slightly like a Dalí clock), floating geometric solids (a wireframe icosahedron slowly rotating, a translucent cube tumbling gently), abstract eye shapes that blink very slowly every 8–10 seconds, a trail of floating golden keys drifting upward on one side of the page, a cluster of soap-bubble-like spheres with iridescent CSS gradients, and a few paper origami cranes that bob gently up and down. Each of these elements is positioned absolutely, scattered at various vertical positions along the page, placed on different parallax layers so they drift at different speeds relative to scroll, creating a rich, layered, dreamlike depth. They all have subtle CSS animations — gentle rotation, floating up-and-down with ease-in-out sine curves, slow pulsing glow via box-shadow or filter blur changes. None of them should obstruct content; they live in the margins and gaps.

## Typography & General Text Styling

The primary heading font is a elegant serif like "Playfair Display" or "Cormorant Garamond," used for the developer's name and section titles. Body text and descriptions use a clean, light sans-serif like "Inter" or "Outfit" in a soft off-white (#e8e0f0) color. All text has a very subtle text-shadow with a lavender or pale blue glow (0 0 20px rgba(160, 140, 255, 0.3)) to make it feel like it's luminous within the dream. Links are rendered in a warm gold (#d4af37) that brightens and gains a stronger glow on hover. Heading text uses a slightly larger letter-spacing for an airy, ethereal feel.

## Header / Hero Section

When the page first loads, the screen is entirely the dark indigo void with only the drifting particles visible. After a 0.5-second pause, the developer's name "Geva Kipper" fades in slowly (over 1.5 seconds) in large serif text, centered both vertically and horizontally, as if materializing from the dream itself — using a CSS animation that goes from opacity 0 and a slight blur (filter: blur(8px)) to full clarity. The name is rendered in white with a faint warm-gold gradient shimmer that slowly animates across the letters using a moving background-clip gradient. Below the name, after a 0.3-second staggered delay, a single line fades in with the same blur-to-clear animation in a smaller, lighter sans-serif: his role and current work at Google, in soft off-white. Below that, after another stagger, a subtitle line appears in italicized serif, slightly smaller, in a muted lavender tone (#a89ec9): "This website is redesigned each day by AI — you are seeing a version that will never exist again." This line has a very gentle, slow CSS opacity pulse (fading between 0.6 and 1.0 opacity over 6 seconds) to subtly suggest its transient, dream-like impermanence. As the user begins to scroll down, the hero text drifts upward at a slightly slower rate than the scroll (parallax), and gently increases in blur and decreases in opacity, as if sinking back into the dream as the user moves deeper.

## Content Cards — General Layout and Style

The six project sections plus the links section are presented as floating "dream cards" — rectangular panels with generously rounded corners (border-radius: 20px), a semi-transparent glassy background (background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.04) with a backdrop-filter: blur(16px) and a very faint border of 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08)). This creates a frosted-glass or glassmorphism aesthetic that feels like looking through translucent dream windows. Each card has a very subtle box-shadow that glows softly in a different hue — the six cards cycle through: pale blue, soft pink, muted gold, sea-green, lavender, and warm coral — giving each card its own dreamy color identity without being garish. The glow is very soft (box-shadow: 0 0 40px rgba(color, 0.12), 0 8px 32px rgba(0,0,0,0.3)).

The cards are arranged in a staggered layout — not a rigid grid, but alternating slightly left and right of center as the user scrolls down, like thoughts floating at different positions in a dream. Odd-numbered cards are offset roughly 5% to the left of center, even-numbered 5% to the right. They also have very slight random rotations (transform: rotate between -1deg and 1deg), enhancing the floating, untethered feeling. Each card is roughly 700px max-width on desktop, narrowing to full-width with padding on mobile.

Each card uses a scroll-triggered entrance animation: as the card enters the viewport, it transitions over 0.8 seconds from opacity 0 and translateY(60px) and a slight blur to its final position, fully clear. The stagger between elements within each card (title, description, links) is 0.1 seconds each. On hover, each card gently lifts upward by 4px, its glow intensifies slightly, and its border brightens — a dreamy "you're focusing on this thought" effect.

## Card 1 — GlglStats

The card's accent color is a warm amber/gold. At the top of the card, the project title "GlglStats" is displayed in serif font, with a small decorative musical note icon (SVG, glowing faintly in gold) floating beside it. Below the title, a concise description in sans-serif explains the project: a Python tool measuring repetitiveness in Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression, with visualizations of repetition patterns in famous songs. Below the description, there is an embedded YouTube video player (iframe) for the PyData TLV presentation, styled with rounded corners and a faint glowing amber border to match the card's accent. The iframe should be responsive (16:9 aspect ratio container). Below the video, a link labeled "Explore GlglStats →" points to https://glglstats.geekip.dev, styled as a gold text link with an arrow that slides right on hover.

## Card 2 — Ahuzat Dibuk

The card's accent color is a soft teal/sea-green. The title "Ahuzat Dibuk" appears with a small car/parking icon (simple SVG, perhaps a minimalist top-down car shape) floating beside it, glowing in teal. The description explains it as a Python scraping and data visualization project collecting Tel-Aviv parking lot occupancy statistics and generating heat-maps for residents. Below the description, three links are listed vertically with small labels: "Featured on Channel 13 News →" linking to the 13tv URL, "Featured on Mako →" linking to the Mako URL, and "Original post on Facebook →" linking to the Facebook group post. Each link is styled consistently in the gold link style, with a small external-link icon next to each.

## Card 3 — 2D Part Orienting

The card's accent color is a cool pale blue. The title "2D Part Orienting" is accompanied by a small floating geometric shape — a simple polygon (pentagon or irregular quadrilateral) rendered as an SVG outline in pale blue, slowly rotating. The description explains it as a C++ implementation within an open-source computational geometry library of an efficient algorithm for constructing a push plan to orient a given polygon. A link "View Project & Code →" points to the TAU CGL project page.

## Card 4 — The Turing Jest

The card's accent color is a playful soft pink/magenta. The title "The Turing Jest" has a small comedy/drama mask icon or a speech bubble with "ha!" beside it, glowing in pink. The description explains it as an LMSYS-style arena where LLMs compete at making and explaining puns, with user ratings. A link "Try The Turing Jest →" points to https://jest.geekip.dev.

## Card 5 — Rhymes of Israel

The card's accent color is a warm lavender/purple. The title "Rhymes of Israel" has a small quill pen or scroll icon glowing in lavender. The description explains it as a Chrome extension using an LLM to rewrite Israeli news headlines into comedic rhymes in the style of a highschool yearbook. A link "Install Chrome Extension →" points to the Chrome Web Store URL, with a small Chrome icon next to it.

## Card 6 — This Portfolio Site (Meta)

The card's accent color is a shimmering iridescent effect — instead of a single accent color, the card's border and glow slowly cycle through multiple colors using a CSS hue-rotate animation on a gradient, making it feel special and self-referential. The title reads "This Very Website" with a small infinity symbol or recursive spiral icon. The description playfully notes the meta nature: this is the portfolio site itself, AI-generated daily, a constantly shifting digital dream. A link "You are already here →" points to https://geekip.dev and on hover, the text gently wobbles with a CSS animation to acknowledge the recursive humor.

## Card 7 — Connect / Social Links

This final card is slightly different in shape — wider and shorter, more like a banner. Its accent glow is a gentle warm white-gold. The title reads "Find Me" or simply shows three large, evenly spaced social icons rendered as clean SVG: the GitHub octocat, the LinkedIn logo, and the Facebook "f" — each in soft white, each enclosed in a faint circular border. Below each icon, the handle/URL is displayed in small text. On hover, each icon and its circle glow brighter in the card's accent color and scale up slightly (transform: scale(1.1)) with a smooth 0.3s transition. The GitHub icon links to github.com/gevak, LinkedIn to linkedin.com/in/gevakip, and Facebook to facebook.com/geva.kipper.

## Footer

Below the last card, with generous spacing, the footer sits centered. In small, muted lavender text (around 14px), it reads: "Dreamt into existence by [AI model name/identifier]" — crediting the AI that designed the site. Below that, a live stopwatch is displayed in a monospaced font (like "JetBrains Mono" or "Fira Code"), showing the time elapsed since February 12, 2026 at 01:30:17 UTC in the format "XXd XXh XXm XXs" — days, hours, minutes, and seconds, ticking live via JavaScript's setInterval updating every second. The stopwatch digits have a soft glow effect matching the overall dream theme. The entire footer gently fades in opacity as it reaches the very bottom, as if dissolving back into the void of the dream.

## Responsive Behavior

On tablet and mobile, the cards lose their left-right offset and center-align in a single column. The floating decorative surreal elements reduce in number (hide some via media queries) to avoid clutter on small screens. The parallax depth effect reduces in intensity on mobile (or disables entirely if using touch detection) to keep scrolling smooth. The YouTube embed in card 1 scales proportionally. The hero text sizing scales down gracefully. All glassmorphism effects remain but backdrop-filter blur may reduce slightly for performance on lower-end devices.

## Scroll & Interaction Details

The parallax is implemented via JavaScript listening to the scroll event (or using IntersectionObserver for card entrance animations and a scroll listener for positional parallax). The background particle layer translates at 0.2x scroll speed, the nebula blobs at 0.4x, content at 1x (normal), and foreground decorative elements at 1.3x, creating the layered depth. A very subtle mouse-follow effect on the hero section (before scrolling) would add magic: the floating elements near the top shift very slightly based on mouse position (using a gentle transform: translate offset calculated from cursor coordinates), as though the dream responds to the dreamer's gaze. This effect should be subtle — maximum 15px offset — and should smooth-interpolate with requestAnimationFrame for buttery motion. A custom smooth-scrolling behavior is applied to the entire page for a more dreamlike, fluid scroll feel. The page uses CSS scroll-behavior: smooth and potentially a lightweight JS smooth-scroll library for a slightly decelerating ease-out scroll.
