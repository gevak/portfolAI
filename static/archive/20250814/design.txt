**Overall Theme and Mood**  
The website will have an airy, minimalist feel with a pure white background, resembling a large digital whiteboard. All text, sketches, and UI elements will appear as *hand-drawn doodles*—black pencil strokes with subtle imperfections, slightly wavy lines, and occasional playful ink smudges—generated as lightweight SVG animations. As the user scrolls, elements draw themselves onto the page with quick, organic "hand sketching" animations, as though an invisible marker is racing ahead of them. The palette will be almost entirely monochrome (black lines on white) with single-color accents for emphasis—fresh sky blue for links and interaction prompts.

**Header**  
At the top: a large, handwritten-style name: **"Geva Kipper"** drawn as if with a marker, appearing in a two-second animated stroke. Beneath it, in slightly smaller doodled text: *"Currently building things at Google"* accompanied by a small sketch of a laptop with rays shooting out of it, looping subtly in animation.  
Just below: A subtitle in playful, slightly chaotic handwriting:  
*"This site is re-designed each day by AI – you’ll never see the same one twice"*  
This subtitle will have faint animated background scribbles that change in form on each refresh.

**Layout & Navigation**  
The page is a single continuous vertical scroll, but each project appears inside a slightly wobbly *hand-drawn rectangle*, like boxes on a notebook page. A vertical doodle-arrow down the left margin loosely connects each section—sometimes with little animated stars and lightning bolts appearing along the line. Each project box has a hand-sketched heading, small doodle icons relevant to the content (e.g., musical notes for GlglStats, parking signs for Ahuzat Dibuk), and then text appearing as if being handwritten in front of the user.  

The boxes will be arranged in **three pairs**—two side-by-side per “row” when on a large screen, stacking vertically on smaller devices.

**Sections**  

1. **GlglStats** — The box outline is animated with repeating rhythmic waves along the edges to hint at musical cycles. Inside: short project description in hand-drawn type, a doodle of stacked musical notes connected by loops, a clickable blue hand-drawn link to *glglstats.geekip.dev*, and below the description, a sketched “play button” linking to the PyData TLV video.  

2. **Ahuzat Dibuk** — The outline has small doodled parking lot icons along the border. Text in the hand-drawn style explains the project. Links to the two TV news sites appear as hand-sketched newspaper icons, while the Facebook link appears as a crude doodle of a thumbs-up with the ‘f’ drawn over it.  

3. **2D Part Orienting** — Box borders look like polygon outlines being “pushed” by tiny doodle arrows. Link to the TAU project page drawn as a clickable page icon.  

4. **The Turing Jest** — Scribbled comedy/tragedy masks at the corners, and a pair of chat bubbles with hand-drawn letterforms inside. Link to *jest.geekip.dev* rendered as a doodled punny “signpost.”  

5. **Rhymes of Israel** — Wavy, poetic border style. Headline example doodles crossed out and rewritten in rhyme. Blue highlighted link to install the Chrome extension.  

6. **This very portfolio** — Meta recursion doodle: a sketched computer screen showing a smaller version of itself, containing another smaller version—like infinite recursion. Clickable to *geekip.dev*.  

7. **Social Links** — A final doodle box styled like a contact card torn from a notebook page. Hand-drawn GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook icons—when hovered, they “fill in” with blue marker animation.

**Footer**  
Thin hand-sketched horizontal separator. Below it:  
*"This page brought to you today by an AI"* in playful cursive handwriting.  
To the right, a doodled analog stopwatch ticking in real-time, showing the running time since **2025-08-14 01:09:42**—numbers dynamically replacing themselves in a slightly bouncy fashion every second.  

---

**Interactive & Dynamic Details**  
- Hovering over any hand-sketched link darkens and thickens the line stroke, mimicking pressing harder with a marker.  
- All animations are quick, organic line drawings—SVG paths being revealed progressively to give a feeling of someone sketching in real time.  
- Daily refresh changes certain doodles, background scribbles, and border embellishments, so the site truly feels “redesigned” each time.  
- Smooth scrolling with subtle soft “page flip” sound effects between sections.

Would you like me to now produce a **full visual wireframe + style guide** for this layout so your designer can implement it pixel-perfect? That would help ensure the creative “whiteboard doodle” theme feels consistent across the site.
