# Design for Geva Kipper's Self-Evolving Portfolio Website

## Core Concept
A minimalist, single-page website that visually evolves based on visitor interactions. The site appears as a digital organism that responds and adapts to user behavior, with elements that shift, grow, and transform in real-time.

## Layout Foundation
The background starts as a subtle grid of dots representing a "digital petri dish" where the website evolves. As visitors interact, the dots connect to form organic patterns that reflect the collective interaction history of all users.

## Header Section
At the top, "Geva Kipper" appears in a bold, modern sans-serif typeface, followed by a single elegant line about his current work at Google. Beneath this, a subtitle explains the self-modifying nature of the website, styled in a slightly smaller, lighter font.

## Interactive Evolution Mechanics
Each visitor action (clicks, scrolls, mouse movements) adds "digital DNA" to the site. Visual elements gradually shift throughout a session - colors subtly change, borders become more organic, and animations become more fluid based on interaction patterns.

## Project Boxes Design
Five project boxes arranged in a flexible grid that repositions based on visitor focus. Each box begins as a simple rectangular container with a thin border, minimal shadow, and plenty of whitespace.

As visitors interact with specific boxes:
- The box expands slightly
- Its border becomes more visually distinct
- A unique pattern grows from the corners, unique to each project
- A subtle color gradient emerges based on user interaction time

## Project Content Styling
Each project box contains:
- Project title in medium-weight sans-serif
- Concise description in light-weight text
- Relevant links styled as subtly animated buttons
- For video/visual projects, thumbnail images with slight parallax effects

## Interactive Elements
- Mouse trails leave temporary "traces" that influence the site's evolution
- Hover states create ripple effects that spread across the layout
- Scrolling generates gentle waves of transformation across the page
- Click actions create small "growth bursts" in the digital ecosystem

## Footer Design
The footer contains credit to the AI creator in an elegant, small typeface. The stopwatch counting from May 16, 2025 appears as a minimalist digital counter that pulses gently every second.

## Responsive Behavior
The design adapts not only to screen sizes but also to the collective interaction patterns. On mobile, the evolution is more touch-oriented, with elements responding to swipes and taps in unique ways.

## Color Scheme
The palette begins with minimal monochromatic tones but evolves toward subtle accent colors based on user interaction. The site "learns" color preferences from collective visitor behavior.

## Typography
Clean, modern sans-serif typography that gradually adjusts letter-spacing and weight based on reading patterns. Text becomes more visually optimized for each visitor over time.

## Daily Reset Mechanism
Each day at midnight, the site partially "resets" its evolution while retaining some characteristics from the previous day, creating a unique version that still carries the memory of past interactions.
