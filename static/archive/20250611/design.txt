### Portfolio Design: The Git Timeline

**Overall Concept:**

The website is a single, vertically scrolling page that visually represents a Git commit history. The central element is a dynamic, animated "main" branch line that runs down the center of the screen. As the user scrolls, they are moving forward in time along this timeline. Projects are represented as "feature branches" that diverge from the main line, with their content displayed adjacent to them. The aesthetic is clean, dark-themed, and interactive, with subtle animations guiding the user experience.

**Color Palette and Typography:**
*   **Background:** A deep, dark charcoal (`#1a1a1d`).
*   **Main Timeline:** A soft, neutral grey (`#6c757d`).
*   **Text:** Off-white (`#f8f9fa`) for readability.
*   **Branch/Accent Colors:** Each project branch has a unique, soft pastel color (e.g., pale blue, muted mint, dusty rose, soft gold). This color is used for the branch line itself and for hover effects within that project's section.
*   **Font:** A modern, clean sans-serif like 'Inter' or 'Montserrat'.

**On-Load / Header Section:**

The page loads with a black screen. An animation draws the first "commit" node at the top center of the page. From this node, the text fades in:

**Geva Kipper**
*(Senior Software Engineer at Google, crafting the future of cloud infrastructure.)*

Below this, in a slightly smaller, italicized font with a subtle "glitch" or "typing" effect:

*This site's design is regenerated by an AI model daily. What you see today may be gone tomorrow.*

A soft, pulsing down-arrow appears below the text, prompting the user to scroll.

**The Interactive Timeline & Project Sections:**

As the user scrolls, the central grey "main" branch line animates downwards. At specific scroll points, a new "commit" node appears on the main line, and a new colored feature branch animates out from it, arcing gracefully to the left or right. As the branch line draws, its corresponding content box fades into view beside it.

**1. GlglStats (Branch #1 - Pale Blue, to the right)**
The pale blue branch connects to a borderless content area.
*   **Title:** `Project: GlglStats`
*   **Description:** An analysis of Israeli pop-song repetitiveness using the LZ77 compression algorithm, featuring interactive visualizations of song patterns.
*   **Links (displayed as clean, icon-based buttons):**
    *   `[Globe Icon]` **Live Site:** `https://glglstats.onrender.com/`
    *   `[Play Icon]` **Watch Talk:** An embedded YouTube player for `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo` appears seamlessly within the section.

**2. Ahuzat Dibuk (Branch #2 - Muted Mint, to the left)**
The muted mint branch connects to its content area on the opposite side.
*   **Title:** `Project: Ahuzat Dibuk`
*   **Description:** A data scraping project that collects and visualizes occupancy statistics for Tel-Aviv parking lots, generating heat-maps to help residents find parking.
*   **Links (icon-based buttons):**
    *   `[Newspaper Icon]` **In The News:** `https://13tv.co.il/...`
    *   `[Newspaper Icon]` **In The News:** `https://www.mako.co.il/...`
    *   `[Facebook Icon]` **Original Post:** `https://www.facebook.com/...`

**3. 2D Part Orienting (Branch #3 - Dusty Rose, to the right)**
The dusty rose branch connects to its content area.
*   **Title:** `Project: 2D Part Orienting`
*   **Description:** A C++ implementation of an efficient algorithm for constructing a 'push plan' to orient any given polygon, contributed to an open-source computational geometry library.
*   **Links (icon-based buttons):**
    *   `[Code Brackets Icon]` **Info & Code:** `https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/...`

**4. The Portfolio (Branch #4 - Soft Gold, to the left)**
The soft gold branch animates out and forms a loop, pointing back towards the page itself.
*   **Title:** `Project: This Website`
*   **Description:** A meta-project: an ever-changing, AI-designed portfolio visualizing a career as an interactive Git graph.
*   **Links (icon-based buttons):**
    *   `[Link Icon]` **Live Site:** `https://portfolio-dor1.onrender.com/`

**5. Final Merge Commit (Centered)**
After the last project branch, all colored branch lines animate to converge back into the central grey timeline at a final, larger "commit" node. Hovering over this node causes it to expand slightly and reveal three icons, representing the final "merge" of all work into a public profile.
*   `[GitHub Icon]` links to `github.com/gevak`
*   `[LinkedIn Icon]` links to `linkedin.com/in/gevakip`
*   `[Facebook Icon]` links to `facebook.com/geva.kipper`

**Footer:**

Below the final merge commit, at the very bottom of the scroll, the timeline fades out and two pieces of text appear at opposite ends of the screen.

*   **Left-aligned:** `Design by Claude 3 Opus, an AI Model.`
*   **Right-aligned:** A live stopwatch with the label: `Time since last redesign: [HH:MM:SS]` counting up continuously from the timestamp `2025-06-11 05:05:49`.
