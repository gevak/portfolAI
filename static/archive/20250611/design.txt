### **Overall Concept & Layout**

The entire website viewport is a single, large, static CSS-art depiction of a classic, light-grey retro Game Boy. The console's body, rendered with subtle gradients and shadows for a 3D effect, frames the content. The D-pad, A/B buttons, and Start/Select buttons are all visible and interactive elements. The main content of the portfolio exists exclusively within the Game Boy's green-tinted, dot-matrix-style screen. The user navigates the single page by either physically scrolling or by using the clickable on-screen D-pad buttons (Up/Down). All text is rendered in a pixelated, monospace font (e.g., Press Start 2P) to maintain the retro aesthetic.

### **The "Screen" - Initial View**

On page load, the Game Boy "screen" flickers to life with a classic fade-in animation. The initial view is a title screen. At the top, in large, blocky pixel letters, is the name: **GEVA KIPPER**. Below it, in a slightly smaller font, is his role: "Software Engineer at Google, developing core infrastructure for scalable systems."

Beneath this, a blinking pixelated cursor precedes the subtitle: "> This website is redesigned daily by an AI and is ever-changing."

The entire screen area acts as a "Press Start" button. A faint, pulsing text "VIEW PROJECTS" sits at the bottom of the screen, inviting the user to click or scroll down.

### **Navigation & Interaction**

As the user scrolls or clicks the "Down" arrow on the D-pad, the title screen content smoothly scrolls up and off the screen, replaced by the first project section. Each of the five sections is a distinct "screen" of content that slides into view.

*   **D-Pad:** The on-screen Up and Down buttons are clickable and smoothly scroll the user between the five project sections. They gain a darker "pressed-in" look via CSS on click.
*   **A/B Buttons:** These buttons provide subtle, non-essential animations. Clicking the 'A' button might cause a quick screen flash, while the 'B' button could trigger a pixelated particle effect, adding a playful, interactive layer without affecting navigation.
*   **Links:** All external links are styled to look like selectable menu items. On hover, they become slightly brighter, and a small, black, right-pointing triangle (`▸`) appears to their left. Clicking a link provides a brief "bleep" sound effect before opening the URL in a new tab.

### **The Five Content Sections (Screens)**

Each section is framed as a new screen within the Game Boy. A thin, horizontal pixel-art line separates each section from the next as the user scrolls.

    *   **Icon:** A small pixel-art icon of a musical note (♪) next to the title.

5.  **Contact & Links**
    *   **Icon:** A small pixel-art icon of an address book or a simple user profile.
    *   **Title:** `CONNECT`

### **Footer Area**

After the final "Connect" section, at the very bottom of the scrollable content, is the footer.

*   A line of pixelated text reads: `DESIGN BY CLAUDE 3 // AN AI ASSISTANT`
*   Below that is a live-updating stopwatch with a unique label, rendered in the same pixelated font:
    `TIME SINCE AI GENESIS: [ 0000:00:00 ]`
    This timer will actively count up in hours, minutes, and seconds from the timestamp 2025-06-11 01:10:21 UTC.
