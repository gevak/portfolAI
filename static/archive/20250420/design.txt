# Digital Laboratory Portfolio Design for Geva Kipper

## Core Concept
A digital laboratory environment where each project is represented as an interactive experiment on a lab bench. As visitors scroll or navigate, they'll feel like they're moving through a high-tech lab with different workstations, each showcasing a unique experiment.

## Layout & Navigation

The site features a dark background with neon accent lighting in blue and purple tones. The laboratory aesthetic combines modern digital elements with classic scientific equipment visuals.

The header displays "Geva Kipper's Digital Lab" in a futuristic, clean font, with a subtitle noting "Currently Engineering at Google" beneath it. Below this, an animated disclaimer appears: "This laboratory reconfigures daily through AI - what you see today may transform tomorrow" with a subtle morphing effect between different layouts.

Navigation is controlled by scrolling or clicking on floating "specimen jars" at the right side of the screen that light up as you approach each section.

## Project Displays

Each project is presented on a virtual lab bench with the following elements:

1. **GlglStats Station**
   - Represented as a sound wave analyzer with interactive frequency visualizations
   - Animated compression visualization showing how LZ77 works on song lyrics
   - Features a floating holographic musical note that visitors can interact with
   - Clear links to the live project and PyData TLV conference video
   - Microscope-style zoom feature to examine song repetition patterns

2. **Ahuzat Dibuk Workstation**
   - Shows a 3D model of Tel Aviv with heat maps that pulse to show parking activity
   - Interactive time-lapse slider to show how parking availability changes
   - News articles appear as floating digital tablets around the model
   - Scraping visualization shows data being collected into test tubes

3. **2D Part Orienting Apparatus**
   - Features a physics sandbox where visitors can create polygons and watch them orient
   - Glowing geometric shapes with blueprint-style overlays showing algorithm steps
   - Code snippets appear as digital lab notes floating beside the demonstration

4. **Meta Portfolio Section**
   - Designed as a recursive "lab within a lab" with mirrors creating an infinite effect
   - Shows miniature versions of the current site layout that visitors can manipulate
   - Features a "version history" timeline showing different daily AI designs

5. **Contact Terminal**
   - Presented as a futuristic communication station with glowing connection points
   - GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook icons appear as 3D holographic badges
   - Each social link has a unique particle effect when hovered over

## Interactive Elements

- Cursor appears as a digital pipette/lab tool that changes based on what you're hovering over
- Gentle ambient laboratory sounds with subtle electronic music
- Floating particles that react to mouse movement, resembling microscopic specimens
- Interactive lab equipment that visitors can manipulate to reveal more project details
- Each section has a small "experiment result" that animates when in view

## Footer

At the bottom of the laboratory, a researcher's station displays:
- "Laboratory designed by [AI Model Name]" in technical font
- A glowing digital stopwatch showing time elapsed since April 20, 2025, styled as if measuring a long-running experiment
- A subtle animation of digital code flowing beneath the floor

## Responsive Behavior

On mobile, the lab transforms into a more vertical layout with station-to-station navigation and condensed experiment displays for optimal viewing on smaller devices.
