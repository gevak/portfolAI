**Visual Concept: The Sentient Terminal**

**Global Aesthetic & Atmosphere**
The website should embody a "living code" aesthetic, merging high-end glassmorphism with a futuristic command-line interface. The background is a deep, void-black (#0a0a0a) featuring faint, slowly drifting geometric grid lines or floating binary particles that track the mouse movement. The typography should be a mix of crisp, monospaced fonts (like Fira Code or JetBrains Mono) for headers and data labels, paired with a clean geometric sans-serif (like Inter) for body text to ensure readability. The dominant accent color is a shifting neon gradient (cyan to violet) that pulses slowly, simulating a heartbeat.

**Header Section: The Identity Block**
At the top left, fixed in place, display "Geva Kipper" in a large, glitched-text effect that occasionally flickers. Immediately below, in a smaller, distinct terminal green, write the line: "Software Engineer at Google." Use a blinking cursor at the end of this sentence. To the right of the header, place a semi-transparent badge with a pulsing border containing the required meta-text: "NOTICE: This interface is re-designed daily by AI. Current iteration: [Current Date]. Status: Evolving."

**The Core Experience: Split-Screen Interview Layout**
Divide the main viewport into two distinct vertical sections (collapsing to a single column on mobile).

**Left Column: The AI Avatar & Controller**
This section represents the "Interviewer" interface.
1.  **The Avatar:** In the center, render a 3D wireframe sphere or a abstract low-poly face that rotates and morphs slightly. This represents the AI. It should have "eyes" that follow the user’s cursor.
2.  **The Interaction:** Below the avatar, display a chat-input simulation. Instead of an empty text box, show a list of "suggested questions" that the user seemingly just asked (e.g., "Show me your work on compression," "What about data scraping?").
3.  **Dynamic Reaction:** When the user hovers over a project card in the right column, the AI Avatar in the left column should change color or shape to match the theme of that specific project.

**Right Column: The Data Stream (Project Boxes)**
This section acts as the AI's "Response History." It contains the 6 project boxes arranged in a masonry or grid layout. Each box should look like a high-tech "data card"—frosted glass background, rounded corners, and a thin glowing border.

1.  **Card 1 - GlglStats:** Style this card with a background animation of subtle audio waveforms. The title should be bold. Include the description of the LZ77 compression and Israeli pop chart repetitiveness. The link to `glglstats.geekip.dev` should be a glowing button labeled "ACCESS TERMINAL." Embed the YouTube video thumbnail as a holographic projection within the card that plays on hover.

2.  **Card 2 - Ahuzat Dibuk:** Give this card a "Map/Radar" visual theme. A faint heatmap overlay should sit behind the text about Tel-Aviv parking scraping. The links to the news stories (13tv, Mako) and the Facebook post should be styled as "News Ticker" items or "Source citations" at the bottom of the card.

3.  **Card 3 - 2D Part Orienting:** Use a geometric, wireframe background motif (polygons). Describe the C++ algorithm and the "push plan." The link to the project page should be styled as a code comment button (e.g., `// View Source & Docs`).

4.  **Card 4 - The Turing Jest:** Design this card with a "Chat Bubble" duality theme (Human vs. Bot). Describe the LMSYS-like arena for puns. The link to `jest.geekip.dev` should be a "Play/Rate" button. Add a small visual Easter egg where a robot icon laughs (represented by text "HA-HA-HA") on hover.

5.  **Card 5 - Rhymes of Israel:** Use a vintage newspaper texture blended with the dark theme. The text describes the Chrome extension and the "highschool yearbook" style. The link to the Chrome Web Store should appear as a prominent "Install Extension" badge.

6.  **Card 6 - The Meta-Portfolio:** This card should feature a "droste effect" (infinity mirror) visual as the background image—showing a small screenshot of the current specific site. The text describes this self-referential project. The link to `geekip.dev` describes it as "Return to Recursion."

**Footer: Connectivity & System Status**
The bottom of the page acts as the system footer.
1.  **Social Links:** Create a "Connection Dock" with three large, stylized illuminated icons for GitHub (`gevak`), LinkedIn (`gevakip`), and Facebook (`geva.kipper`). When hovered, they should impart a neon glow to the surrounding area.
2.  **The AI Credit:** Text centered at the bottom: "Site architecture generated by [Your AI Model Name]."
3.  **The Chronometer:** A highly distinct, digital clock font (red or amber) displaying "SYSTEM UPTIME." It must show the time elapsed since **2026-01-14 01:16:06**. Since this date is in the future relative to the current time, the stopwatch should visually indicate a "Time Paradox" or negative counting, or simply count up from that future date implying the site is from the future. Format: `YY:DDD:HH:MM:SS`.
