A single-page “Neural Network Visualizer” portfolio that behaves like a living model training on Geva Kipper. The hero section fills the first viewport with a dark, elegant canvas (charcoal-to-deep-indigo gradient) where a stylized neural network floats: nodes glow softly, edges pulse with moving “signals,” and clusters subtly rearrange as if the model is continuously learning. Centered over the canvas: **Geva Kipper** in a clean modern grotesk (e.g., Inter / Söhne-style), with one crisp line beneath: “Software engineer at Google, currently building and scaling data-driven systems.” Below that, a lighter subtitle: “Re-designed each day by AI — an ever-changing layout generated from today’s ‘training run’.” A small “Daily seed” label (date-based) appears in the corner, implying the day’s design variant, while interactions (hover/scroll) briefly animate “activation waves” through the network.

Scrolling reveals the content as **seven** distinct “learned memories” (cards) arranged in a responsive grid that looks like it’s being **assembled by the network**. Each box is a glassy panel with subtle noise texture, rounded corners, and a thin luminous border that brightens when “activated.” Every card has a consistent internal structure: a bold project title, a one-sentence summary, then “Artifacts” chips (links) that look like model outputs (small pill buttons with icons). On hover, the neural network behind (or a mini-network inside the card header) highlights the “path” that supposedly led the model to that memory: edges light up from the hero network to that card, and a tiny “confidence” meter slides from ~0.6 to ~0.9 for playful effect. The daily AI re-design theme shows up through small variations: card order shuffles slightly, accent colors rotate among a tasteful palette (teal, violet, amber), and node cluster positions change—always within a stable layout so usability remains high.

**Box 1: GlglStats** appears as a “compression/sequence” themed card: the header includes a minimal LZ77-like ribbon visualization (blocks repeating with slight offsets). Copy: “Python project measuring repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs via LZ77 compression, plus repetition-pattern visualizations of famous tracks.” Artifacts chips: **Live site** (https://glglstats.geekip.dev) and **PyData TLV talk (video)** (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo). The card’s micro-interaction: hovering “plays” a silent looping animation of repeating bar patterns compressing into fewer blocks.

**Box 2: Ahuzat Dibuk** uses a “city heat-map” motif: a faint Tel-Aviv grid silhouette and a shifting thermal gradient band inside the header. Copy: “Python scraping + data visualization project collecting Tel-Aviv parking lot occupancy and generating resident-friendly heat-maps.” Artifacts chips: **News story (13tv)** (https://13tv.co.il/item/news/domestic/internal/parking-902956407/), **News story (mako)** (https://www.mako.co.il/nexter-news/Article-ae43964b891bf71027.htm), and **Original Facebook post** (https://www.facebook.com/groups/secrettelaviv/posts/10159636301195943/). Hover effect: heat intensifies briefly around “high occupancy” regions, then settles.

**Box 3: 2D Part Orienting** is “geometry/precision” themed: crisp line-art polygons with a subtle “push plan” arrow overlay in the header, like a CAD blueprint. Copy: “C++ implementation in an open-source computational geometry library: an efficient algorithm constructing a push plan to orient a polygon.” Artifact chip: **Additional info + code** (https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/). Hover effect: the polygon rotates in discrete, purposeful steps (not smooth), emphasizing algorithmic planning.

**Box 4: The Turing Jest** is “arena/LLM duel” themed: the header shows two chat bubbles facing off, with a playful but restrained typographic twist (slightly exaggerated punctuation marks as decorative glyphs). Copy: “An LMSYS-like arena where LLMs compete at making and explaining puns, rated by users.” Artifact chip: **Live site** (https://jest.geekip.dev). Hover effect: a score bar flickers between two sides and a tiny “judge” node in the network above lights up, implying crowd evaluation.

**Box 5: Rhymes of Israel** is “headline-to-rhyme” themed: the header features a mock browser tab strip and a headline transforming into a rhyming couplet via an animated “rewrite” underline. Copy: “Chrome extension that uses an LLM to rewrite Israeli news headlines into comedic rhymes, high-school yearbook style.” Artifact chip: **Install on Chrome Web Store** (https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eainginjgdkpgolpjniijdihfbeeeklb). Hover effect: a headline morphs into a rhyming version with subtle type shuffling, like a model decoding tokens.

**Box 6: Portfolio website (meta)** is “self-referential” themed: the header contains a miniature version of the neural network itself learning a tiny card that looks like the card you’re reading—recursion without being gimmicky. Copy: “A portfolio website project (how meta): the site you’re currently exploring.” Artifact chip: **Self-reference** (https://geekip.dev). Hover effect: the card border loops a soft “inference” scanline from top-left to bottom-right, hinting at continual generation.

**Box 7: Links / presence** is clean and minimal, acting like an “output layer.” It contains three large elegant link rows with subtle brand hints but consistent styling: **GitHub** (github.com/gevak), **LinkedIn** (linkedin.com/in/gevakip), **Facebook** (facebook.com/geva.kipper). Each row has a small icon and a trailing arrow, and hovering triggers a neat “activation” pulse from the network to that specific row, as if selecting the final output.

The footer is understated and precise. On the left: “Generated by an AI model (ChatGPT) — design authored on request.” On the right: a “Time since genesis” stopwatch labeled clearly, counting **hours : minutes : seconds** since **2025-12-26 01:10:34**. The stopwatch is styled like a lab instrument readout (monospace digits, subtle glow), tying back into the neural-network-lab aesthetic. The entire page maintains accessibility and clarity: high contrast text, calm motion by default with a visible “reduce motion” toggle, and all links presented as distinct, tappable chips within each project card.
