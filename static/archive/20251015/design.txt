# Retro Elevator Portfolio Design

The website opens with a rich, textured background resembling aged wallpaper from a 1970s office building—burnt orange with subtle geometric patterns. The entire viewport is dominated by a large, brass-framed elevator shaft display panel positioned centrally. This panel features an illuminated floor indicator at the top showing floor numbers 1-7 in classic segmented LED style (think vintage calculator displays in amber glow).

The main interactive element is a detailed Art Deco elevator car that physically travels up and down within the visible shaft. The elevator has ornate brass gates, a diamond-pattern metal grille, and a small circular window showing the current "floor number" in stitched fabric numbering. Above the elevator shaft, a brass plate displays "GEVA KIPPER" in engraved lettering with "Software Engineer at Google, working on [current role in one sentence]" in smaller art deco typography beneath it. Directly below this, in a flickering neon sign style with pink and blue tubing, reads: "This portfolio redesigns itself daily through AI—永遠に変化する."

The elevator operates via a column of circular brass call buttons mounted on the right side of the shaft, each button numbered 1-7 with individual backlit halos that glow warm yellow when active. When clicked, the elevator smoothly animates upward or downward with appropriate mechanical sounds (optional: cable creaking, distant machinery humming). As the elevator arrives at each floor, accordion-style brass gates slide open with a satisfying clank, and the corresponding content panel expands outward from behind the elevator shaft.

Each floor's content panel emerges as a frosted glass window with brass rivets at the corners, featuring slightly yellowed paper texture overlays. The panels slide out to the left of the elevator shaft, creating an L-shape composition:

**Floor 1 (GlglStats)**: The panel displays the project title in typewriter font with musical note dingbats. Below, descriptive text appears in monospace green text reminiscent of old computer terminals. The project link appears as a vintage push-button interface, while the PyData presentation link is styled as a film reel icon with "WATCH PRESENTATION" in retro cinema lettering.

**Floor 2 (Ahuzat Dibuk)**: The panel features a heat-map color gradient border (red to green) with Hebrew-style decorative elements. News article links are presented as folded newspaper clippings with yellowed edges and authentic newspaper mastheads visible. The Facebook link appears as a torn piece of notebook paper pinned with a vintage thumbtack graphic.

**Floor 3 (2D Part Orienting)**: This floor uses blueprint aesthetics with white line drawings on deep blue background. Geometric polygon shapes float subtly in the background. The project link is styled as a rolled blueprint with a red wax seal.

**Floor 4 (The Turing Jest)**: The panel features a comedy club spotlight effect with a curtain texture background in deep red velvet. The title uses marquee bulb lettering that subtly pulses. A laughing emoji rendered in pixel art style sits in the corner.

**Floor 5 (Rhymes of Israel)**: Israeli flag colors (blue and white) frame the panel with a chrome browser icon integrated into a vintage Israeli newspaper masthead design. The install link is a chunky 3D button with chrome metallic shading and reflection effects.

**Floor 6 (Portfolio Meta)**: The panel shows an infinite mirror effect—a smaller version of the elevator shaft reflecting into itself, creating a recursive visual. The link is an ouroboros (snake eating its tail) styled in brass relief.

**Floor 7 (Social Links)**: The top floor opens to reveal three vintage rotary phone dial faces, each labeled with a social platform. Clicking each dial spins it and navigates to the respective link. The GitHub logo appears in punch-card aesthetic, LinkedIn in business card emboss, and Facebook in a polaroid photo frame.

At the bottom of the page, below the elevator shaft, a small brass maintenance plaque reads: "This establishment designed and maintained by [AI Model Name] • Est. 2025" with a mechanical flip-clock style counter below showing "Time in operation: XXh XXm XXs" counting from the specified timestamp, with each segment flipping like vintage airport departure boards.

The color palette throughout uses brass gold (#B8860B), aged copper (#C87533), burnt orange (#CC5500), deep mahogany (#4E2A1E), cream (#FFFDD0), and amber LED glow (#FFBF00). Shadows are deep and dramatic to enhance the physical, tangible quality of all elements. Hover states add subtle brass polish shine effects using CSS gradients that sweep across interactive elements.
