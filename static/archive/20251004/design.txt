# Spotify Wrapped-Inspired Developer Portfolio Design

## Overall Aesthetic
The page uses a dark gradient background transitioning from deep purple (#1A0B2E) at the top through midnight blue (#2D1B69) to a rich teal (#16213E) at the bottom, mimicking Spotify's signature wrapped aesthetic. All content is contained within a smooth vertical scroll experience with subtle parallax effects. A grain texture overlay adds warmth and depth across the entire page.

## Hero Section
At the top, "Geva Kipper" appears in a bold, extra-large sans-serif font (like Circular or similar) in vibrant lime green (#1DB954), Spotify's signature color. Below it, in lighter gray text: "Building innovative solutions at Google" followed by a playful subtitle in italicized text with a gradient shimmer effect: "This portfolio redesigns itself daily through AI – a living, breathing digital canvas."

## Project Cards Layout
The six project boxes are arranged in a dynamic, asymmetric grid. Rather than uniform rectangles, each card is a rounded-corner "bubble" with a distinct neon accent color (cycling through pink, cyan, yellow, orange, purple, and green). Cards alternate between left-aligned and right-aligned in a zigzag pattern down the page, creating visual rhythm.

Each card features:
- A bold project title in white at the top
- A colored horizontal progress bar underneath (purely decorative, representing "completion" but actually just aesthetic)
- Description text in light gray
- Links styled as pill-shaped buttons with the card's accent color, featuring subtle hover animations that make them pulse
- For GlglStats and Ahuzat Dibuk, small "Featured" badges in the top-right corner
- The YouTube and news links appear as small icon buttons with recognizable platform colors

**Card 1 (GlglStats)**: Pink accent (#FF006E). Features a stylized waveform graphic in the background suggesting music visualization.

**Card 2 (Ahuzat Dibuk)**: Cyan accent (#00F5FF). Background shows a faint heatmap pattern illustration.

**Card 3 (2D Part Orienting)**: Yellow accent (#FFD60A). Subtle geometric polygon shapes float in the background.

**Card 4 (The Turing Jest)**: Orange accent (#FF6B35). Comedy masks or sparkle emojis decoratively placed.

**Card 5 (Rhymes of Israel)**: Purple accent (#9D4EDD). Background features subtle Hebrew letters in very low opacity.

**Card 6 (Portfolio Meta)**: Green accent (#06FFA5). Includes an infinity symbol graphic and the self-referential link styled with a mirror/reflection effect.

## Stats Bar Between Sections
Between project cards, thin horizontal "stat bars" appear (Spotify wrapped-style), displaying playful coding statistics in bright text: "7 Projects Shipped," "∞ Lines Debugged," "100% Passion," etc. These add visual breaks and maintain the wrapped theme.

## Social Links Section
Card 7 sits at the bottom as a wider, horizontal card with a holographic gradient border. The three social platform icons (GitHub, LinkedIn, Facebook) are large, monochromatic, and arranged horizontally with generous spacing. On hover, each icon fills with its platform's brand color and lifts with a 3D transform effect.

## Footer
A sleek footer bar in semi-transparent black features small text on the left: "Designed by [AI Model Name] on [Date]" and on the right, a minimalist digital stopwatch display showing "Time Since Last Update: XXh XXm XXs" with the numbers in the same lime green accent color, updating in real-time via JavaScript.

## Animations
Smooth scroll-triggered fade-ins for each card, subtle float animations on the project cards, and a dynamic cursor trail effect of tiny colored dots that follows mouse movement, reinforcing the playful, modern tech aesthetic.
