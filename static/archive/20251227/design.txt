Single-page concept: the whole portfolio is styled as a living unit-test dashboard for “Geva Kipper”. The hero area looks like a minimalist test runner (think modern CI UI) on a dark, elegant background with subtle grid/noise texture. At the very top: **“Geva Kipper”** in a clean mono/neo-grotesk pairing, followed by one sentence: **“Software engineer at Google, currently building and scaling production systems.”** Beneath it, a smaller subtitle line in a lighter weight: **“This portfolio is re-designed each day by AI—expect it to evolve.”** A thin “run status” strip sits under the header: a single animated progress bar that eases to 100%, then flips to “All checks passed” (or “N checks pending”) depending on scroll position, reinforcing the test theme.

Core interaction: the page contains a vertical “test suite” timeline with **seven test cards** (the six project sections plus the final social-links box). Each card is a “test case” row that initially appears as **pending** (muted dot + “queued”), with the project title rendered like a test name (e.g., `test_glglstats_repetition_analysis()`), and a short one-line assertion-style teaser beneath (e.g., “assert repetition_can_be_measured_with_LZ77”). As the visitor scrolls and each card enters the viewport, it animates through states: queued → running (subtle moving shimmer / spinner) → **passed** (green check). The green check is not just decorative: when it turns on, it **unlocks** the “project story” inside the card—expanding smoothly to reveal richer content (description, links, and embedded media where relevant). The experience feels like discovering the work by “passing” each test.

Layout: each “test card” is a refined glassy panel with crisp borders, gentle shadows, and a slight tilt/hover parallax. The left edge of the page has a thin vertical line acting as the test runner spine, with state markers aligned to each card (circle icons that fill green on pass). On desktop, cards alternate slightly left/right offsets for visual rhythm, while on mobile they stack straight. Each card has a compact top row: status icon, test name, and a tiny duration badge (fake but tasteful, e.g., `128ms`) that appears after passing. The “duration” for each can be subtly thematic (short for small tools, longer for researchy projects), adding playful authenticity.

Cards content (unlocked on pass):
1) **GlglStats** card: headline “GlglStats” with a “Python” pill tag. Story text: “Python project measuring repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression; visualizes repetition patterns across famous songs.” Include two clear buttons: **Visit: https://glglstats.geekip.dev** and **PyData TLV talk (YouTube): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo**. The unlocked area shows a mini visualization motif: a horizontal “compression bar” with repeating segments, purely decorative but evocative.

2) **Ahuzat Dibuk** card: headline “Ahuzat Dibuk” with “Python / Scraping / Data Viz” pill tags. Story text: “Scraping and visualization project collecting Tel-Aviv parking lot occupancy and generating resident-friendly heat maps.” Prominently place “Featured in” links as three small publication chips:  
- https://13tv.co.il/item/news/domestic/internal/parking-902956407/  
- https://www.mako.co.il/nexter-news/Article-ae43964b891bf71027.htm  
- https://www.facebook.com/groups/secrettelaviv/posts/10159636301195943/  
Unlocked visual motif: a tiny heatmap legend strip (cool-to-warm gradient) and a faint grid-map background watermark inside the card.

3) **2D Part Orienting** card: headline “2D Part Orienting” with “C++ / Computational Geometry” tags. Story text: “Open-source library implementation of an efficient algorithm constructing a ‘push plan’ to orient a polygon.” Add one primary link button: **https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/**. Visual motif: thin-line polygon outlines that subtly rotate or “snap” into orientation after the checkmark appears.

4) **The Turing Jest** card: headline “The Turing Jest” with “LLMs / Arena” tags. Story text: “An LMSYS-like arena where LLMs compete at making and explaining puns; users rate the results.” Add a bold call-to-action button: **https://jest.geekip.dev**. Visual motif: chat bubbles that morph into a punchline “spark” icon, restrained and classy.

5) **Rhymes of Israel** card: headline “Rhymes of Israel” with “Chrome Extension / LLM” tags. Story text: “Chrome extension that rewrites Israeli news headlines into comedic rhymes in the style of a highschool yearbook.” Add install link button: **https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eainginjgdkpgolpjniijdihfbeeeklb**. Visual motif: a headline line that transforms into a rhyming couplet with a subtle typewriter effect after unlock.

6) **Portfolio (Meta Test)** card: framed as `test_portfolio_can_explain_itself()` with a playful but elegant tone. Story text: “A portfolio website project—how meta! This very page is the artifact.” Add self-reference link: **https://geekip.dev**. Visual motif: a small “recursive” icon (nested rectangles) that gently loops once on unlock.

7) **Links / Social** card: treated as the final test: `test_contact_endpoints_resolve()`; once passed, it reveals three large, clean icon-buttons (outline style) plus full URLs for clarity:  
- GitHub: **github.com/gevak**  
- LinkedIn: **linkedin.com/in/gevakip**  
- Facebook: **facebook.com/geva.kipper**  
Keep it minimal and confident, like the summary section of a build.

Global polish: the color palette is mostly charcoal/ink with crisp whites and a single signature **CI green** for checks; occasional muted accent (cool blue) for links and hover states. Typography mixes a modern mono (for test names, badges, timestamps) with a clean sans for paragraphs. Motion is restrained: short easing, no gimmicks—just enough to feel “alive.” Sound is optional and off by default (no autoplay), but the design can suggest a tiny “✓ passed” tick via micro-animation.

Footer: a slim “build summary” bar that reads like a final pipeline line: “Generated by AI model (OpenAI) — daily redesign enabled.” Next to it, a **stopwatch** component labeled “Time since 2025-12-27 01:08:56” showing live-updating **HH:MM:SS**. The stopwatch is styled like a CI timestamp: mono digits, subtle border, and a faint pulsing colon. The very bottom ends with a quiet “All checks passed” line once the user reaches the footer, completing the narrative loop of green checks unlocking the full story.
