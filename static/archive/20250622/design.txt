**Website Design: "The Geva Kipper Scroll"**

**Overall Concept & Aesthetic:**

The website is a single-page, horizontal side-scrolling experience, presented as a minimalistic 2D game. The aesthetic is clean, dark-themed, and inspired by digital schematics or a vector-based "Tron" world. The background is a very dark navy (#0a192f) with a subtle, slow-moving parallax grid of faint cyan lines, giving a sense of depth and movement. The user's only action is to scroll right, which moves a simple, glowing digital avatar (a small, pulsating white cube) along a single horizontal line that acts as the "ground." As the avatar travels, it encounters "milestones," which are the five content sections. All typography is a clean, modern sans-serif like 'Inter'.

**The "Loading" & Initial View:**

Upon visiting the site, the user sees the far-left of the game world. The glowing cube avatar is stationary at the starting point. Floating directly above it is the primary text, which appears with a soft fade-in:

**Geva Kipper**
*Software Engineer at Google, focusing on [brief, single-sentence description of his work].*

Below this, a smaller subtitle animates as if being typed out by an AI:
`> This portfolio is procedurally redesigned by AI daily. The experience is always evolving.`

A subtle, animated arrow pulses, pointing to the right, prompting the user to begin scrolling.

**The Journey: Milestones as Levels**

As the user scrolls right, the cube avatar moves along the line. The journey is punctuated by five distinct "monoliths" or interactive structures that rise from the ground line. Each monolith represents a project or section. As the avatar approaches a monolith, the structure and its text content elegantly fade into view.

1.  **Level 1: GlglStats Monolith**
    The first monolith is a shimmering structure made of vertical bars resembling a sound equalizer. As the avatar gets close, the background parallax grid subtly morphs into gently oscillating sine waves. The monolith's text content appears:

    **GlglStats:** A Python project measuring the repetitiveness of Israeli pop music using LZ77 compression, featuring interactive visualizations of song patterns.

    Two interactive buttons glow beneath the text. One is labeled "Explore the Site" (linking to the project), and the other "Watch PyData Talk" (linking to the YouTube video). The buttons can be simple, outlined rectangles that fill with color on hover.

2.  **Level 2: Ahuzat Dibuk Monolith**
    Further down the timeline, the second monolith is a sleek, rectangular block that emits a faint, heatmap-style glow (from cool blue to warm orange). The background parallax grid behind this section shifts into a subtle, abstract representation of a city map grid. The text content fades in:

    **Ahuzat Dibuk:** A data project that scrapes and visualizes parking occupancy in Tel-Aviv, generating predictive heatmaps to help residents find parking.

    Three circular icons appear below: a newspaper icon (for the 13tv.co.il link), another newspaper icon (for the Mako link), and a Facebook 'f' logo (for the Facebook post link). Hovering over an icon reveals the source's name.

3.  **Level 3: 2D Part Orienting Monolith**
    The third monolith is a crystalline structure, with faint, rotating wireframe polygons visible inside it. The theme is computational geometry. The text appears:

    **2D Part Orienting:** A C++ implementation of an efficient algorithm for constructing a 'push plan' to orient any given polygon, contributed to an open-source computational geometry library.

    A single, clear call-to-action button appears: "View Code & Details".

4.  **Level 4: The Meta Monolith**
    This fourth structure is an "impossible" object, like a Penrose triangle or an Escher-inspired shape, slowly rotating. The background parallax grid behind it is composed of faint, scrolling lines of CSS/JS code snippets, hinting at the site's own creation. The text reads:

    **This Portfolio:** A meta-project demonstrating a unique approach to a personal website, built with modern web technologies and a dynamic, game-like interface.

    The button below is a simple, underlined link: "You are here: portfolio-dor1.onrender.com".

5.  **Level 5: The Contact Hub**
    At the end of the scroll, the horizontal line terminates into a "hub" â€” a larger, brightly glowing circle on the ground. Three smaller, pulsating orbs float above it. There is no descriptive text. Each orb is an icon: GitHub's Octocat, a LinkedIn 'in' logo, and a Facebook 'f' logo. They are the only elements in this final screen, drawing full attention. Hovering on an orb makes it glow brighter and expand slightly before clicking.

**Footer & Final Elements:**

At the very bottom of the page, fixed and separate from the scrolling game world, is a simple, one-line footer. It remains visible throughout the experience.
