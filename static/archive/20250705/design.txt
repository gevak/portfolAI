### Website Design: The Generative Canvas

**Overall Concept:**
The entire website is a single, continuous canvas of interactive, generative art. This background is not static; it's a living entity, an abstract visualization of code in motion. It consists of slowly moving particles, interconnected nodes, and flowing lines of light. The art subtly reacts to the user's cursor, creating ripples or a soft glow, making the user a part of the visual experience. The color palette, particle behavior, and geometric patterns of this background art are algorithmically generated anew each day, using the date as a seed.

**Header Section:**

At the top of the page, floating above the generative art, is clean, minimalist text.

*   **Developer Name:** In a bold, large, and elegant sans-serif font: **Geva Kipper**.
*   **Affiliation:** Directly below the name, in a lighter font weight: "Currently building intelligent, large-scale systems at Google."
*   **Subtitle:** A line below, perhaps in a slightly italicized or monospaced font to differentiate it: "This portfolio is algorithmically redesigned by AI every 24 hours. What you see today is unique and will not exist tomorrow."

**Content Sections (The "Glass Panels"):**

As the user scrolls down, six content sections appear sequentially. They are not traditional boxes but appear as semi-transparent "glass" panels, using a frosted glass effect (CSS `backdrop-filter`). This allows the generative art background to be visible through them, reinforcing the theme. The panels have a thin, softly glowing border whose color is derived from the day's generated color palette. They are arranged in a slightly staggered single column, alternating slightly left and right of the center to create a more dynamic vertical flow.

Each panel contains a small, stylized, generative art "icon" specific to the project, which animates subtly on hover.

**1. Project: GlglStats**
*   **Visual Icon:** A miniature, abstract visualization of repeating audio patterns, like colored blocks forming a barcode that loops and pulses.
*   **Title:** **GlglStats**
*   **Description:** A Python project measuring the repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression, with visualizations of repetition patterns.
*   **Links:** Two distinct, icon-based buttons. One with a "globe" icon labeled "Visit Site" (linking to `glglstats.geekip.dev`), and another with a "play" icon labeled "Watch PyData Talk" (linking to the YouTube video).

**2. Project: Ahuzat Dibuk**
*   **Visual Icon:** A slowly shifting, pixelated heatmap, with colors warming and cooling in a gentle loop.
*   **Title:** **Ahuzat Dibuk**
*   **Description:** A Python scraping and data visualization project generating real-time heatmaps of Tel-Aviv parking lot occupancy to assist residents.
*   **Links:** Three icon-based buttons. Two with a "newspaper" icon labeled "As seen on 13tv" and "As seen on Mako". The third uses a "Facebook" icon labeled "The Original Post".

**3. Project: 2D Part Orienting**
*   **Visual Icon:** An animated geometric diagram showing a polygon and glowing vectors ("pushes") appearing around its perimeter to orient it.
*   **Title:** **2D Part Orienting**
*   **Description:** A C++ implementation of an efficient algorithm for constructing a 'push plan' to orient a given polygon, contributed to an open-source computational geometry library.
*   **Links:** A single button with a "code" (`</>`) icon labeled "View Project & Code".

**4. Project: The Turing Jest**
*   **Visual Icon:** A branching, tree-like structure of nodes, representing conversational paths, with small sparks of light traveling between them.
*   **Title:** **The Turing Jest**
*   **Description:** An LMSYS-style arena where Large Language Models compete at generating and explaining puns, with user-based rating and voting.
*   **Links:** A button with a "trophy" or "jester hat" icon labeled "Enter The Arena".

**5. Project: The Generative Portfolio**
*   **Visual Icon:** A recursive animation of the website itselfâ€”a tiny glass panel inside which an even tinier glass panel is visible, creating an infinity mirror effect.
*   **Title:** **This Website**
*   **Description:** A self-referential project. This portfolio itself is a testament to creative front-end development, designed to be unique every single day.
*   **Links:** A button with a "loop" or "refresh" icon labeled "Top of Page", linking to `geekip.dev`.

**6. Contact & Socials**
*   **Visuals:** This panel contains no project description, just three large, clean icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook. On hover, the icon and its glowing border brighten significantly.
*   **Links:** Each icon links directly to the respective profile (`github.com/gevak`, `linkedin.com/in/gevakip`, `facebook.com/geva.kipper`).

**Footer Section:**

At the very bottom of the page, as the scroll ends, the text fades in, centered and unobtrusive.

*   **AI Credit:** In a small, humble font: "This daily design was generated by a custom-instructed GPT-4 model."
*   **Live Stopwatch:** Below the credit, a simple, monospaced digital clock.
    *   **Label:** "Generation Uptime:"
    *   **Counter:** A live-ticking clock showing the hours, minutes, and seconds that have passed since the timestamp `2025-07-05 01:06:07`. E.g., `[ 11347:22:15 ]`.
