# Music Synthesizer Portfolio Design for Geva Kipper

## Overall Concept & Layout

The page presents as a sleek, dark-themed digital synthesizer interface reminiscent of classic Moog or modern Arturia synths. The background is a deep charcoal (#1a1a2e) with subtle animated waveform patterns slowly undulating across it in muted purple and cyan gradients. The entire page is framed as a hardware synthesizer unit with rounded corners, metallic trim effects using CSS gradients, and faux screws in the corners.

## Header Section

At the top sits an LCD-style display panel with a glowing backlit effect (soft green or amber glow). Inside this display, "GEVA KIPPER" appears in a pixelated/digital font like "VT323" or "Press Start 2P", with a blinking cursor animation. Below the name, in smaller LCD text: "Software Engineer @ Google". Underneath, in even smaller text with a subtle fade-in-out animation: "This interface is redesigned daily by AI — each visit, a new composition."

## The Keyboard & Project Boxes

The main section features a horizontal piano keyboard spanning roughly two octaves (14 white keys, 10 black keys). Six of the white keys are specially marked with glowing LED dots above them in different colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple). These correspond to the six project sections.

Above the keyboard sits a "patch bay" area — a grid of six rectangular modules arranged in two rows of three, styled like synthesizer modules with knobs, sliders, and small LED indicators as decorative elements. Each module represents one project and remains in a "dormant" state (dimmed, showing only the project title in a small label-tape style strip) until its corresponding key is pressed or hovered.

## Project Module Design

**Module 1 - GlglStats (Key: C, Color: Red)**
When activated, the module "powers on" with an animation — LED indicators light up, a VU meter bounces. The module expands slightly and reveals: Project title in label-maker font, a brief description about measuring Israeli pop song repetitiveness using LZ77 compression, visualizing repetition patterns. Below, two circular "jack plug" style buttons link to the live site and the PyData TLV YouTube presentation. Small animated sound wave visualization plays within the module.

**Module 2 - Ahuzat Dibuk (Key: D, Color: Orange)**
Parking lot heat-map theme. When active, tiny animated car icons move within the module. Description about Tel-Aviv parking data scraping and visualization. Three "output jack" styled links to the news stories (13tv, Mako) and the Facebook post. A mini heat-map graphic pulses gently in the background of the module.

**Module 3 - 2D Part Orienting (Key: E, Color: Yellow)**
Geometric theme. When active, an animated polygon slowly rotates and repositions itself within the module border. Description of the C++ computational geometry implementation for polygon push-plan construction. Single link styled as a patch cable connector to the TAU project page.

**Module 4 - The Turing Jest (Key: F, Color: Green)**
Comedy/arena theme. When active, animated speech bubbles with "HA!" float up within the module. Description of the LMSYS-style LLM pun competition arena. Link to the jest site styled as a "battle" button with versus iconography.

**Module 5 - Rhymes of Israel (Key: G, Color: Blue)**
Chrome extension presented with a stylized browser icon. When active, text scrambles and reforms into rhyming couplets animation. Description of the LLM-powered headline rewriting extension. Chrome Web Store link styled as a download/install button with the Chrome puzzle piece icon.

**Module 6 - This Portfolio (Key: A, Color: Purple)**
Meta-recursive design — this module contains a tiny recursive image of the synthesizer itself. When active, creates a brief "inception" zoom effect. Description acknowledging the self-referential nature. Link to geekip.dev styled as a "recursion" infinite loop symbol.

## Keyboard Interaction

When a key is hovered or clicked, it visually depresses with a subtle shadow shift, and a synthesizer tone plays (Web Audio API sine wave at the appropriate pitch). The corresponding module above illuminates and expands. Multiple keys can be active simultaneously, creating visual "chords" of information. Inactive modules remain visible but dimmed.

## Social Links Section

Below the keyboard, styled as the synthesizer's "I/O panel" — a brushed metal strip with three round "jack socket" connectors labeled GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Each socket has a glowing ring (white, blue, blue respectively) and connects via an animated "patch cable" line when hovered.

## Footer

The bottom edge of the synthesizer features an engraved manufacturer plate. Text reads: "Designed by Claude (Anthropic) — Model: Claude Sonnet" in an elegant serif font. Next to it, an LED digital clock display showing the elapsed time since November 28, 2025 01:03:59 in HH:MM:SS format, updating live, labeled "UPTIME".

## Typography & Colors

Primary font: "Instrument Sans" or "Space Grotesk" for modern readability. Display elements: "VT323" or "Digital-7" for LCD screens. Labels: "Special Elite" for label-maker strips. Color palette: Dark base (#1a1a2e, #16213e), metallic accents (#4a4e69, #9a8c98), neon highlights (#00fff5 cyan, #ff006e magenta, #8338ec purple), warm LED glows for each project module.

## Animations & Sound

Subtle constant animations: background waveforms flowing, LED indicators softly pulsing, VU meters occasionally twitching. On interaction: key depression, module expansion, patch cable connections animating. Optional: actual synthesizer tones when keys are pressed, creating a playable musical experience while browsing projects.
