The overall aesthetic is a sleek, modern "digital vault" using a dark UI theme. The color palette features a deep slate-gray background (#0f172a), frosted glass containers (glassmorphism via backdrop-filter), and glowing neon cyan (#06b6d4) and amber (#f59e0b) accents. Typography should be a crisp sans-serif like Inter or Roboto Mono to emphasize the engineering theme. Smooth CSS transitions will handle all interactions, ensuring a premium, tactile feel. 

At the top of the page, the hero section prominently displays the name "Geva Kipper" in a glowing, heavy font. Right below, a crisp sentence states: "Currently building high-impact, scalable software solutions as a Software Engineer at Google." Underneath this, a monospace subtitle with a simulated typing effect reads: "SYSTEM NOTE: This website's design is regenerated daily by an AI, resulting in an ever-changing digital landscape."

The core body of the page uses a responsive CSS Grid layout displaying seven frosted-glass "vault boxes." Initially, the inner content of each box is hidden, replaced by a unique JavaScript-driven micro-puzzle related to the project inside. The locked state glows faintly with an amber lock icon, which turns cyan upon successful solution, triggering an elegant fading-unfold animation that reveals the actual content and links. 

Box 1 (GlglStats) requires the user to solve a pattern puzzle. The lock screen displays a sequence of generated color blocks. The user must identify and click the single block that breaks the repeating sequence (nodding to the LZ77 compression algorithm). Once unlocked, it reveals a clean card detailing the Python project that measures the repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs and visualizes their patterns. It includes prominent hyperlink buttons to the site (https://glglstats.geekip.dev) and the PyData TLV presentation (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo).

Box 2 (Ahuzat Dibuk) features a mini, interactive heatmap grid as its lock. The user must click the "greenest" (most vacant) square in the grid to unlock it. The revealed content details the Python scraping and data visualization project for Tel-Aviv parking lot occupancies. UI elements should include clean, rounded tags for "Scraping" and "Data Viz," alongside three linked icons pointing to the news stories on Channel 13 (https://13tv.co.il/item/news/domestic/internal/parking-902956407/), Mako (https://www.mako.co.il/nexter-news/Article-ae43964b891bf71027.htm), and the original post on Secret Tel Aviv (https://www.facebook.com/groups/secrettelaviv/posts/10159636301195943/).

Box 3 (2D Part Orienting) features a small HTML canvas puzzle where the user must drag a horizontal "pusher" bar to rotate a floating geometric 2D polygon until it sits flat. Unlocking this reveals the C++ computational geometry project detailing the efficient alignment algorithm implementation. The open-source code and algorithm info are styled as a terminal-like block containing the link: https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/2d-part-orienting/ 

Box 4 (The Turing Jest) is unlocked by a localized A/B voting mechanism. Two buttons display opposing AI pun setups, and voting for either "model" shatters the lock. The resulting view introduces the LMSYS-like arena where LLMs compete at making/explaining puns based on user ratings. A glowing call-to-action button links directly to the arena: https://jest.geekip.dev

Box 5 (Rhymes of Israel) utilizes a simple drag-and-drop rhyme mechanics. The user must drag a missing word into a placeholder to complete a standard rhyming couplet. Once unlocked, a comedic, yearbook-styled UI card explains the Chrome extension that uses an LLM to rewrite Israeli news headlines into highschool-style rhymes. An animated "Add to Chrome" badge directs users to the Chrome Web store: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eainginjgdkpgolpjniijdihfbeeeklb

Box 6 (Portfolio Website) is a meta-puzzle. The lock interface is a miniature, pixel-art version of the very website they are currently looking at. Clicking the "mini Box 6" inside this graphic triggers an infinite-zoom CSS animation that unlocks the section. The revealed text cheekily points out the self-reference of building the portfolio site they are currently experiencing, paired with a recursive link to https://geekip.dev

Box 7 acts as the master terminal spanning the bottom of the grid. It consists of three draggable nodes labeled "G", "L", and "F". The user must draw a connecting laser line through all three to unlock the social hub. Once engaged, it unfurls to display sleek, hover-animated social icons routing to GitHub (github.com/gevak), LinkedIn (linkedin.com/in/gevakip), and Facebook (facebook.com/geva.kipper).

The footer is minimalist and anchored to the bottom. It contains a small AI badge reading "Design dynamically assembled by [Your Model Name], an AI architecture system." Next to this is a live, ticking digital stopwatch (in an LED-style font). A JavaScript interval function should constantly calculate and display the exact hours, minutes, and seconds that have elapsed since the baseline timestamp: 2026-02-24 01:27:16.
