### The ASCII Metropolis Design

The website is a single, continuous vertical scroll, simulating a journey from a digital sky down through a sprawling, animated ASCII art metropolis, and into its data-stream foundations. The entire page uses a dark, near-black background (`#0d0d0d`) with a primary text color of a classic, glowing CRT green (`#33ff33`). Accent colors for links and interactive elements are a vibrant cyan (`#00ffff`) and a cautionary amber (`#ffbf00`). The font is a crisp, modern monospaced font like 'Fira Code' to ensure all ASCII characters align perfectly.

**The Sky & Introduction:**

The page loads with the top of the viewport showing an ASCII-art sky. Subtle, single-character stars (`.` `*` `+`) twinkle in and out of existence. Floating serenely in the center are large ASCII letters forming the name: **GEVA KIPPER**. Below it, in a smaller, solid green font, is the sentence: "Developing the future of search at Google."

Directly beneath this, contained within an animated, boxy ASCII billboard with a flickering border, is the subtitle: `> THIS SITE IS PROCEDURALLY REGENERATED BY AN AI EACH DAY_`. The underscore at the end of the line blinks like a terminal cursor. As the user begins to scroll, the sky fades and the tops of ASCII skyscrapers begin to rise from the bottom of the screen.

**The City of Projects:**

The user scrolls down into the main cityscape. The six project sections are presented as individual, distinct 'buildings' or interactive zones within the metropolis. Each building has a unique ASCII architecture related to its project's theme. On hover, a building and its text content glow slightly brighter, and subtle animations are triggered. All links are styled in cyan and, on hover, are prefixed with a `[>]` symbol.

1.  **The Music Analyzer Tower:** This building is designed like a massive graphic equalizer or a sound wave. Vertical bars of `#` characters of varying heights form its structure. Animated ASCII musical notes (`♪ ♫`) float gently from its peak.
    *   **Title:** `GlglStats`
    *   **Description:** "A Python project measuring the repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression, with visualizations of repetition patterns."
    *   **Links:** `[Visit GlglStats]` and `[Watch PyData Talk]`

2.  **The Data-Grid Garage:** This section is depicted as a top-down view of a city block with a multi-level parking garage. The garage is a grid of `[ ]` characters, some of which are filled with amber `[o-o]` ASCII cars. On hover, a heat-map effect is simulated as the density of the background characters (`.`, `:`, `%`, `#`) changes.
    *   **Title:** `Ahuzat Dibuk`
    *   **Description:** "Python scraping and data visualization project analyzing Tel-Aviv parking occupancy to generate heat-maps for residents."
    *   **Links:** `[News: 13tv.co.il]`, `[News: Mako.co.il]`, `[Original Post]`

3.  **The Geometry Lab:** This structure is an abstract, crystalline form with sharp, clean lines made of `/`, `\`, `_`, and `|`. Next to it, a wireframe polygon made of ASCII characters slowly rotates in 3D space.
    *   **Title:** `2D Part Orienting`
    *   **Description:** "A C++ implementation of an efficient algorithm for constructing a 'push plan' to orient polygons, contributed to an open-source computational geometry library."
    *   **Link:** `[View Code & Info]`

4.  **The Comedy Arena:** This section is styled like a small amphitheater or stage, with a single ASCII microphone `(`-`|)` on a stand under a spotlight made of `\` and `/` characters. In the background, ASCII faces `:-)` `:-|` `:-D` flicker as if they are an audience.
    *   **Title:** `The Turing Jest`
    *   **Description:** "An LLM competition arena where models compete at creating and explaining puns, with user-rated responses."
    *   **Link:** `[Enter The Arena]`

5.  **The Newsprint Press:** This building looks like an old-fashioned printing press, with long vertical strips of scrolling ASCII "lorem ipsum" text running down its sides like paper feeds. An ASCII version of the Chrome logo sits on top.
    *   **Title:** `Rhymes of Israel`
    *   **Description:** "A Chrome extension using an LLM to humorously rewrite Israeli news headlines in the rhyming style of a high-school yearbook."
    *   **Link:** `[Install Extension]`

6.  **The Meta Construct:** The final project is a visual paradox. It's an ASCII representation of a Möbius strip, twisting infinitely. An animated dotted line flows continuously along its surface.
    *   **Title:** `Project: Portfolio`
    *   **Description:** "The meta-project for this very website—an ever-changing, explorable ASCII world designed to showcase my work."
    *   **Link:** `[You Are Here: geekip.dev]`

**The Foundation & Footer:**

Below the last building, the cityscape gives way to the 'underground'—a network of data pipes and conduits. The social links are presented here.

7.  **The Network Hub:** Three thick, horizontal pipes made of `=` characters span the page. Each pipe has a label above it, with an ASCII logo. Hovering over a logo makes the entire pipe glow in the accent cyan color.
    *   `[GitHub Logo]` --> `github.com/gevak`
    *   `[LinkedIn Logo]` --> `linkedin.com/in/gevakip`
    *   `[Facebook Logo]` --> `facebook.com/geva.kipper`

Finally, at the absolute bottom of the page, in the "bedrock," is the footer text in a smaller, amber font.

*   `// Design generated by the GPT-4 model.`
*   Below it, a running stopwatch styled like a classic digital clock:
    `[Time Since Genesis: <hhh>:<mm>:<ss>]`, dynamically counting up from 2025-09-12 01:00:11.
