# AI Chatbot Portfolio Design: Geva Kipper

## Core Concept
An interactive AI assistant interface that responds to user queries about Geva's work. The entire site resembles a futuristic AI terminal with a conversational UI as the primary interaction method.

## Layout

**Header:**
- Minimalist monospace font displaying "Geva Kipper" with a subtle glow effect
- Subtitle: "Software Engineer at Google, specializing in large-scale data systems"
- Smaller text beneath: "This website redesigns itself daily using AI - what you see is unique to today"

**Main Interface:**
- Dark-themed terminal-like window with a glowing blue/green accent line at the top
- Fixed greeting message: "Hello, I'm Geva's AI assistant. Ask me anything about his projects or experience."
- Blinking cursor and text input field where visitors can type questions
- When the page loads, the AI automatically suggests sample questions like "Tell me about GlglStats" or "What is 2D Part Orienting?"

**Project Display:**
- Rather than traditional sections, projects appear as conversational responses
- Each response has expandable cards with:
  - Project title in bold
  - Brief description that appears to be "typed" with animation
  - Links to external resources with subtle hover animations
  - Minimal icons representing technology used
  - For video content (PyData talk), a small embedded player appears

**Visual Elements:**
- Low-opacity code snippets floating in the background, slowly scrolling
- Subtle particle effects that respond to mouse movement
- When typing or receiving responses, gentle typing sounds and keyboard click effects
- Visualization of voice waves when "speaking" responses

**Navigation:**
- Instead of traditional navigation, commands like "/projects", "/contact", or "/about" can be typed
- A small help icon in corner reveals available commands
- Command history accessible with up/down arrows

**Project-Specific Features:**
1. **GlglStats**: When selected, displays a small interactive visualization of song repetition patterns
2. **Ahuzat Dibuk**: Shows a miniature heat map that pulses with parking occupancy data
3. **2D Part Orienting**: Displays a simple animation of a polygon being oriented
4. **Portfolio Website**: Creates a recursive effect when selected, showing a smaller version of the current interface
5. **Social Links**: When accessed, displays as a "network connection" visualization before showing actual links

**Footer:**
- Minimal footer with a digital clock showing time elapsed since 2025-04-05 01:00:42
- Credit line: "Interface designed by [Your AI Model Name]"
- Small toggle for "Light Terminal" vs "Dark Terminal" mode

**Mobile Adaptation:**
- On mobile, the interface becomes more compact
- Typing interface remains but with predefined questions as tappable bubbles
- Projects stack vertically with collapsible details

**Subtle Touches:**
- Random "system messages" occasionally appear: "Analyzing code repositories..." or "Accessing project data..."
- Light cursor trail effect that fades quickly
- Random glitch effects that briefly appear then normalize
- Easter egg: Typing "matrix" triggers a brief cascading code effect
