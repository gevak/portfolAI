# Mario Pipe World Portfolio — Design Description

## Overall Concept and Layout

The entire single-page site is set against a deep sky-blue gradient background reminiscent of the classic Super Mario Bros. overworld sky, complete with a few parallax-scrolling white pixel-art clouds that drift slowly left to right. The ground at the very bottom of the page is a continuous strip of Mario-style brown brick and green terrain tiles that stretches the full width and scrolls subtly with a parallax effect as the user scrolls down. Scattered across the background at various depths are small decorative elements: floating pixel-art bushes, a couple of hills in the mid-ground with the characteristic Mario dotted-outline style, and occasional gold coins that rotate in place with a CSS sprite animation.

The overall vertical structure of the page is one long scrollable column. Between each major section, large green warp pipes emerge from the ground or hang from above, acting as visual connectors. As the user scrolls, a small animated Mario sprite (standing on a pipe at the top of the viewport as a fixed-position element) appears to "jump" and travel downward through the pipes. This sprite is fixed to the right margin of the screen and progresses through a simple idle/walking/jumping animation cycle tied to scroll position — when the user scrolls, Mario jumps; when they stop, he lands and idles. The sprite uses a pixel-art rendering style with `image-rendering: pixelated` to keep the retro crispness.

## Color Palette and Typography

The primary palette draws from the Mario universe: a rich sky blue (#5C94FC) for the background, classic pipe green (#00A800) for interactive elements and accents, brick brown (#C84C0C) for borders and structural elements, gold/yellow (#FCB838) for highlights, hover states, and coin accents, and a crisp white for text on dark backgrounds with a deep navy (#1A1A2E) for card backgrounds to keep readability. Section card backgrounds use a semi-transparent dark navy with a subtle frosted-glass blur effect.

The primary heading font is a chunky pixel-art display font like "Press Start 2P" from Google Fonts, used for the developer name, section titles, and the subtitle. Body text, project descriptions, and links use a clean modern sans-serif like Inter or Space Grotesk at comfortable reading sizes to balance the retro headings with legibility. This contrast between pixel headings and modern body text reinforces the blend of nostalgic theme with professional content.

## Header / Hero Section

At the top of the page, a large horizontal brick block structure spans roughly 60% of the center width, styled to look like the iconic Mario question-mark blocks arranged in a row. The center block is larger and contains a subtle pulsing golden "?" animation. Above this block row, as if Mario just hit it, the developer's name **"Geva Kipper"** pops up in large Press Start 2P font, white with a dark pixel-art drop shadow, accompanied by a small bouncing coin animation beside it. Below the name, in smaller modern sans-serif type, appears a single line: "Software Engineer at Google" — styled in a clean gold color.

Beneath this, a translucent dark banner with rounded pixel-art corners holds the subtitle in a slightly smaller pixel font, colored in a soft green glow: *"This site is redesigned each day by AI — it is ever-changing, never the same twice."* A small animated pixel-art star twinkles beside this text.

Below the hero area, a large green warp pipe rises from the center of the page. Inside the dark opening of the pipe, a small downward-pointing animated arrow bounces, inviting the user to scroll. The pipe has the classic Mario lip/rim at the top, with highlights and shadows giving it a cylindrical 3D feel using CSS gradients.

## Section Cards / Project Boxes

The six project sections plus the social links section are arranged vertically down the page. Each section is a large rounded-rectangle card (max-width around 800px, centered) with a dark navy semi-transparent background, a 3px solid border in pipe-green, and a subtle box shadow in dark green. Each card has a slight tilt or rotation of 0.5–1 degree, alternating left and right, giving a playful hand-placed feeling.

Between every two cards, a connecting warp pipe illustration bridges them. The pipes alternate in style: some are vertical pipes emerging from the bottom of one card and entering the top of the next, some are horizontal L-shaped pipes running along the left or right margin and curving into the next section. These are built with CSS shapes and gradients — simple rounded rectangles in the classic two-tone green with darker green shadows and a highlight stripe. Small particle effects of pixel-art sparkles or stars animate around the pipe openings to suggest magical transportation.

Each card's header area contains a small floating pixel-art item icon unique to that project (described per-section below), followed by the project title in Press Start 2P font colored gold, and then the description in clean white sans-serif body text below.

**Card 1 — GlglStats:** The icon is a pixel-art musical note block (like the Mario music note blocks). The title "GlglStats" appears in gold. The description explains: a Python project measuring repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs based on LZ77 compression, with visualizations of repetition patterns in famous songs. Below the description, two call-to-action buttons are styled as Mario brick blocks — rectangular with a pixel border and a subtle brick texture. The first button, labeled "Visit GlglStats →", links to https://glglstats.geekip.dev and has a green hover glow. The second button, labeled "Watch PyData TLV Talk ▶", links to the YouTube video. Beneath the buttons, a small embedded YouTube thumbnail preview is displayed (a styled link card showing the video URL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo with a play-button overlay in Mario-red), which opens the video in a new tab on click.

**Card 2 — Ahuzat Dibuk:** The icon is a pixel-art car (simple, side-view, Mario Kart–inspired). The title "Ahuzat Dibuk" is in gold. The description explains: a Python scraping and data visualization project collecting Tel-Aviv parking lot occupancy statistics, generating heat-maps for residents. Below, three link buttons styled as item blocks: "Channel 13 News Story" linking to the 13tv.co.il URL, "Mako News Story" linking to the mako.co.il URL, and "Original Facebook Post" linking to the Facebook groups post. Each button has a small pixel-art icon: a TV for the news links and a thumbs-up for Facebook.

**Card 3 — 2D Part Orienting:** The icon is a pixel-art geometric polygon, like a small angular shape rotating slowly with CSS animation. Title: "2D Part Orienting" in gold. Description: a C++ implementation in an open-source computational geometry library of an efficient algorithm for constructing a push plan to orient a given polygon. A single link button, styled as a question-mark block: "Project Info & Code →" linking to the TAU CGL project page.

**Card 4 — The Turing Jest:** The icon is a pixel-art laughing face or jester hat, with a small bobbing animation. Title: "The Turing Jest" in gold. Description: an LMSYS-style arena where LLMs compete at making and explaining puns, with answers rated by users. A link button styled as a star power-up: "Enter the Arena →" linking to https://jest.geekip.dev.

**Card 5 — Rhymes of Israel:** The icon is a pixel-art scroll or newspaper with a small quill, gently swaying. Title: "Rhymes of Israel" in gold. Description: a Chrome extension using an LLM to rewrite Israeli news headlines into comedic rhymes in highschool yearbook style. A link button styled as a Chrome-colored mushroom power-up: "Install Extension →" linking to the Chrome Web Store URL.

**Card 6 — This Portfolio Site:** The icon is a pixel-art green pipe itself, creating a recursive visual joke. Title: "This Very Site" in gold, with a small "(how meta!)" aside in a lighter pixel font. Description: the portfolio website you're looking at right now — a Mario-themed, AI-redesigned-daily experience. A link button styled as a warp pipe entrance: "You Are Here 🌀" linking to https://geekip.dev. When hovered, this button triggers a brief CSS animation where the card border flickers through rainbow colors like a star-power effect.

**Card 7 — Social Links:** This final card is styled differently — it resembles the end-of-level castle from Mario, with a small pixel-art castle silhouette at the top of the card and a tiny flag that waves on a pole using CSS animation. Inside, three large square icon buttons are arranged horizontally, each styled as a distinct Mario item block: the GitHub link (github.com/gevak) uses an octocat icon on a fire-flower–orange block, the LinkedIn link (linkedin.com/in/gevakip) uses the LinkedIn icon on a blue shell block, and the Facebook link (facebook.com/geva.kipper) uses the Facebook icon on a blue-purple mushroom block. Each block bounces slightly when hovered, mimicking the Mario block-hit animation, and the corresponding social icon pops upward like a coin being released.

## Interactivity and Animations

When the page first loads, a brief intro animation plays: the screen is black for half a second, then the classic Mario level-start style appears — a black screen with "WORLD 1-1" in pixel font and "× 1" with a small developer avatar icon, which fades out after 1.5 seconds to reveal the full page with a smooth fade-in. This uses a CSS animation on an overlay div that transitions from opaque to transparent and then sets `pointer-events: none`.

All project cards enter the viewport with a subtle slide-up and fade-in animation triggered by an Intersection Observer in JavaScript, staggered by 100ms each. The pipes between sections draw themselves in (a clip-path or height animation) as the user scrolls into range.

Gold coin collectibles are scattered decoratively in the margins; when a user clicks one, it plays a brief spin-and-disappear animation with a small "+1" floating text, purely for delight. A small coin counter in the top-right corner (fixed position, styled as the Mario HUD) tracks how many coins the user has clicked, displayed in pixel font.

Hover effects on all link buttons include a slight scale-up (1.05), a brighter glow in the accent color, and a quick 50ms CSS transition. The pipe illustrations between sections have a very slow, subtle pulsing glow on their openings, as if light is emanating from inside the warp zone.

## Footer

The footer sits on the ground-tile strip at the bottom. It is styled as an underground Mario zone — a short section with a black/dark-brown background, brick-tile pattern along the top edge, and the ground tiles along the bottom. In the center, in small pixel font colored in a muted green, the AI credit reads: "Designed by Claude, Anthropic's AI — one of many daily-generated designs." Below this, a live stopwatch counts upward from the epoch 2026-02-10 01:52:42, displayed in the format "XXd XXh XXm XXs" using Press Start 2P font in gold, with each unit separated by small pixel-art coin icons. The JavaScript driving this updates every second, calculating the difference between now and the target date. If the current time is before the epoch, it shows a countdown instead. The numbers gently pulse with a CSS animation to draw attention to the passing time.

## Responsive Behavior

On mobile viewports (below 768px), the cards stretch to nearly full width with reduced padding. The decorative pipes between sections simplify to shorter vertical segments. The Mario sprite on the right margin hides to save space. The cloud parallax effect reduces intensity. The hero block row stacks more compactly, and the social link icons in the final card stack vertically rather than horizontally. The intro animation still plays but shortens to 1 second total. All pixel-art elements maintain their `image-rendering: pixelated` quality at any scale.
