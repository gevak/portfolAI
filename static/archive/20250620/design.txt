**Overall Concept: The AI's Terminal**

The website is designed to look and feel like an interactive, elegant command-line terminal. The visitor is not the one typing; instead, they are watching a pre-scripted "conversation" where an AI queries its own database about Geva Kipper and displays the results. The entire page is a single, continuous feed of text that types out in real-time, creating a dynamic and engaging experience. The aesthetic is ultra-minimalistic, relying on typography, spacing, and subtle animations.

**Visual Design & Layout**

The background is a deep, dark charcoal grey (#1E1E1E), not pure black. All text is rendered in a crisp, monospaced font like 'Fira Code' or 'Source Code Pro'. The primary text color is a soft, off-white, with a single, vibrant accent color (e.g., an electric blue or a phosphor green) used for links, command prompts, and highlights.

The page loads to a nearly blank screen with a single, blinking cursor at the top left. After a brief pause, the "conversation" begins to type itself out, character by character.

**The "Conversation" Flow**

1.  **Initiation & Identity:**
    The first lines type out, establishing the scene:
    `[AI_Genesis_2.0]: Initializing session...`
    `[AI_Genesis_2.0]: Accessing subject profile...`
    A moment later, the main header appears, styled larger and bolder:
    `Geva Kipper // Software Engineer at Google, focusing on large-scale data infrastructure.`

2.  **The Ever-Changing Subtitle:**
    Directly below the header, a comment-style line types out, explaining the site's premise:
    `// SYSTEM NOTE: This design is procedurally regenerated daily. Interface is ephemeral.`

3.  **The Project Query:**
    A new prompt appears, simulating a query to the AI:
    `> Retrieve primary project files.`
    The AI responds, and this is where the five content sections are revealed sequentially. Each project is presented as a "file block" that fades in after its introductory line is typed.

**The Five Content "Boxes" (Presented as File Blocks)**

Each "box" is not a literal box with borders, but a block of text, visually separated by space and a leading "file path" line.

*   **(Block 1: GlglStats)**
    The AI types: `[AI]: Loading project: /proj/audio_analysis/GlglStats.py`
    The following text block appears below it:
    `A Python project measuring the repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression. Features visualizations of repetition patterns in famous songs.`
    `[ view live site ] [ watch PyData talk ]`
    The bracketed text (`[ ]`) are the hyperlinks, which glow with the accent color on hover.

*   **(Block 2: Ahuzat Dibuk)**
    The AI types: `[AI]: Loading project: /proj/civic_data/AhuzatDibuk.py`
    The text block appears:
    `A Python scraping and data visualization project analyzing Tel-Aviv parking lot occupancy. Generates public heat-maps to help residents find parking.`
    `[ news: Channel 13 ] [ news: Mako ] [ original post ]`

*   **(Block 3: 2D Part Orienting)**
    The AI types: `[AI]: Loading project: /proj/computational_geometry/PartOrienting.cpp`
    The text block appears:
    `A C++ implementation of an efficient algorithm for constructing a 'push plan' to orient a polygon, contributed to an open-source computational geometry library.`
    `[ view code & info ]`

*   **(Block 4: Meta Portfolio)**
    The AI types: `[AI]: Loading project: /proj/meta/RecursivePortfolio.js`
    The text block appears, with a self-aware tone:
    `The portfolio website you are currently viewing. A self-referential experiment in AI-driven design and minimalist presentation.`
    `[ view source (of a sort) ]`

*   **(Block 5: Contact Links)**
    The AI types a final prompt:
    `> Establish external connection links.`
    The text block appears:
    `[ GitHub ] [ LinkedIn ] [ Facebook ]`
    Each is a direct link to the respective profile.

**Footer Section**

After the final link block, the "conversation" concludes with a sign-off:
`[AI_Genesis_2.0]: All files rendered. Session complete.`
The blinking cursor stops.

At the very bottom of the page, aligned to the right, are two final, static lines in a slightly smaller font size:
`Interface designed & generated by OpenAI's GPT-4.`
`Time since last regeneration: [a live, ticking stopwatch showing HHH:MM:SS passed since 2025-06-20 01:08:41]`
