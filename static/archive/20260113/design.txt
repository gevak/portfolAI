**Visual Aesthetic and Atmosphere**
The visual theme is a high-fidelity recreation of the Windows 95 operating system, tailored for a modern browser environment. The background is the iconic "Windows Teal" (#008080). The user interface relies heavily on the classic "bevel" look—light grey borders (#C0C0C0) with stark white highlights and dark shadows to create 3D distinct buttons and windows. The typography is entirely pixelated, adhering to fonts similar to "MS Sans Serif" or "Pixel Arial" to maintain authenticity. The cursor changes to the classic white pixelated arrow, turning into a glorious hourglass when assets are loading.

**The Desktop (Main Layout)**
The page loads with a retro BIOS boot sequence text that flashes quickly before initializing the desktop. Scattered across the teal desktop are draggable 32x32 pixel icons with dotted-line focus borders. These icons represent the varying sections of the portfolio. By default, three windows are already open and stacked: the "Welcome" window (Bio), the "Daily Log" (AI Subtitle), and a "My Computer" style file explorer. The layout is free-form; the user can drag these windows anywhere on the screen, maximize them, or minimize them to the taskbar.

**The "Welcome" Window (Bio)**
A window titled "Welcome to GevaOS" takes center stage. Inside, there is a layout resembling the classic "System Properties" tab. It features a pixelated avatar of Geva Kipper. Next to the image, bold text reads: **"Geva Kipper"**, followed by the status line: *"Software Engineer at Google."* This window serves as the static anchor for the user’s identity.

**The "Daily Log" (Subtitle & Disclaimer)**
A second, smaller window resembling `notepad.exe` is open. The text area contains a raw Courier New font message: *"This website is re-designed each day by AI and is thus ever-changing."* This window acts as the subtitle, giving the impression of a frantic note left by the system administrator (the AI) before the user logged in.

**Project Windows (The Content)**
The desktop contains icons labeled "Projects." When double-clicked, it opens a file explorer window containing six distinct icons. Double-clicking any of these opens a unique application window for that specific project:

*   **GlglStats:** Opens a window styled like the "Windows Media Player" (classic skin). It features the YouTube embed of the PyData conference talk as the "video screen." Below the video are control buttons (Play/Stop) that are purely aesthetic, and a text description of the Python/LZ77 algorithm. A button labeled "Launch App" links to the external site.
*   **Ahuzat Dibuk:** Opens a window resembling a spreadsheet or data utility. It displays a static heat-map image of the parking lots. The text describes the scraping project, and three large buttons at the bottom link to the 13TV news item, the Mako article, and the Facebook post, styled as "External Resources."
*   **2D Part Orienting:** Opens a window with a black background and bright green text, resembling a Command Prompt (cmd.exe). The text explains the C++ computational geometry algorithm. A solitary angular polygon graphic rotates slowly in the corner using CSS animations. A link to the project page glows at the bottom.
*   **The Turing Jest:** Opens a window styled like a chat interface or an early whimsical game dialog. It describes the LMSYS-like arena for puns. The primary button reads "Enter the Arena" linking to the site.
*   **Rhymes of Israel:** Opens a window with a white background and a header resembling an old web browser (e.g., Netscape or Internet Explorer 3). It showcases the Chrome Extension functionality with a "Download" button linking to the Chrome Web Store.
*   **Portfolio (Meta):** Opens a window displaying an "infinite mirror" effect—a screenshot of the current desktop inside the window, which contains a screenshot of the desktop, recursively. A button labeled "Refresh Recursion" links to geekip.dev.

**Network Neighborhood (Socials)**
An icon on the desktop labeled "Network Neighborhood" opens a folder containing three connections. These are stylized as networked drive icons:
1.  **GitHub:** Labeled as a code repository.
2.  **LinkedIn:** Labeled as a professional profile.
3.  **Facebook:** Labeled as a social directory.
Clicking these opens the respective external links in a new browser tab.

**The Taskbar & Footer Stats**
Fixed to the bottom of the viewport is the classic grey taskbar.
*   **Start Button:** The button on the left features the Windows logo and the word "Start." Clicking it opens a simplistic menu offering "Shut Down" (which simply reloads the page or closes the tab).
*   **Task List:** The center area displays rectangular buttons for every currently open window (Bio, Projects, etc.). Unfocused windows appear raised; the active window appears depressed/clicked.
*   **The System Tray (AI Credit & Stopwatch):** On the far right, inside the sunken tray area, there is a scrolling marquee text (ticker) that reads: *"Site generated by AI Model."* Next to it is the clock. Instead of the standard time, it features a high-precision stopwatch. It calculates the delta between the current time and **2026-01-13 01:09:58**. If the current date is before this timestamp, it shows a countdown (negative time); if after, it counts the elapsed time up in hours, minutes, and seconds, updating every second to emphasize the specific temporal reference requested.
