The website opens as a **minimalistic digital book**, centered against a plain, neutral background (cream-white or soft gray), as if placed on a table. The cover is stark and elegant: the name **“Geva Kipper”** appears in large, serif type, with a single horizontal line beneath it. Underneath: *“Software Engineer at Google, currently working on large-scale ML infrastructure”*. A smaller subtitle sits at the bottom of the “cover”: *“This website is re-designed each day by AI — no visit is ever the same.”* The entire book has a subtle shadow and a smooth “paper texture” to suggest both fragility and intelligence.  

Upon clicking anywhere or tapping, the book **flips open with a smooth page-turn animation** (CSS & WebGL-powered), revealing full-bleed “code pages.” Each “page” is styled like a flat sheet of paper, but the content is overlaid in monospace code-styled text, gently animated to appear like lines being typed. The navigation between sections mimics flipping through a book: the user swipes (on mobile) or clicks arrow buttons at the bottom corners, and the next page turns. Each project or section receives *one dedicated spread (left and right page)*, giving the sense of a physical portfolio catalogue.  

Each **project box** is represented as a “code annotation block,” with a bold heading styled like a comment (e.g., `# GlglStats`), followed by a concise description in lighter monospace type. Links are rendered as subtle, glowing inline references, like function calls in code (e.g., `open("glglstats.geekip.dev")`). Videos and images appear on the facing page, embedded seamlessly but styled to look like printed figures in a technical textbook (framed in faint borders, underlined with captions). For projects like *GlglStats* and *Ahuzat Dibuk*, external links are grouped side-by-side as numbered “references,” giving the impression of academic footnotes.  

The **2D Part Orienting** spread pairs precise typography with a technical drawing motif: faint geometric outlines of polygons as background watermarks. For *The Turing Jest* project, puns and witty sample text animate briefly before fading (styled like humorous compiler warnings). The *Rhymes of Israel* section playfully types out transformed headlines line-by-line in a mock shell console embedded into the page. The “Portfolio Website” section folds back upon itself — the right-hand page is actually a **mirror of the visitor’s current screen**, making it meta and self-aware.  

The final spread is purely connective: links to **GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook** appear as large black-and-white “index tabs” on the right-hand margin, making them tactile and easy to click. The rest of the page is mostly whitespace with only the links centered, like an appendix.  

At the **very bottom of the last page**, typeset in tiny footnote style, is the credit: *“Designed today by an AI assistant”*. To its right, a monochrome **stopwatch counter** continuously ticks upward, showing hours, minutes, and seconds elapsed since *2025-08-24 01:12:14*. The timer itself looks like terminal output, a subtle nod to Geva’s software roots.  

The overall atmosphere blends **minimalist book design, coding aesthetics, and playful interactivity**. Every page flip feels deliberate, quiet, and elegant — a stark contrast to loud, modern portfolios. It’s a site that feels like a rare artifact: timeless, simple, yet alive and ever-changing.
