**Visual Concept: The Symphonic Terminal**

**Global Aesthetic & Atmosphere**
The site acts as an interactive "stage" set against a dark, charcoal-black background (#0a0a0a). The interface combines the elegance of a philharmonic orchestra with the raw utility of a code terminal. The background is not static; it is a dynamic, full-width canvas displaying a massive array of vertical, neon-cyan bars of varying heights, representing an unsorted dataset.

**The "Conductor" Interaction Mechanism**
The user’s cursor is replaced by a glowing, white "Conductor’s Baton." The interaction relies on "Audio-Visual Sorting."
*   **Idle State:** The background bars slowly sway.
*   **Active State:** As the user scrolls or moves the baton, the background array begins to sort itself in real-time using algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort).
*   **Audio:** Each swap or comparison in the sorting algorithm triggers a distinct synthesized sine-wave note (higher values = higher pitch). This creates a cascading "computational music" effect. If the user stops moving the mouse, the music and sorting pause—giving the user full conductive control over the flow of the site.

**Header Section**
Center-aligned at the top, using a sleek, monospaced typeface (e.g., 'Fira Code' or 'Roboto Mono').
*   **Headline:** "Geva Kipper" in large, bold white text.
*   **Byline:** A single sentence fades in below: "Building scalable systems and orchestrating code at Google."
*   **The AI Disclaimers:** A smaller, glitch-effect subtitle pulses below the byline: *"This interface is hallucinated daily. Design generated by AI."*

**The Project Orchestra (Main Content)**
The six project boxes are arranged in a semi-circle arc, mimicking the seating arrangement of an orchestra section. Each box is a glass-morphism card (translucent blur) with a subtle border. When the user hovers over a box with the "Baton," that specific card illuminates, and the background sorting algorithm changes to a specific style associated with the project's complexity.

*   **Box 1: The Lead Violin (GlglStats)**
    *   **Visuals:** An embedded visualization of an LZ77 compression waveform that pulses to the beat of the background sorting audio.
    *   **Content:** Description of the Python pop-chart repetitiveness project.
    *   **Actions:** Two distinct buttons—one linking to the live site, the other triggering a modal overlay playing the PyData TLV YouTube video.

*   **Box 2: The Percussion (Ahuzat Dibuk)**
    *   **Visuals:** A dynamic heat-map graphic serves as the card background, shifting from green to red (simulating parking availability) based on the mouse X-position.
    *   **Content:** Details on the Tel-Aviv parking scraper.
    *   **Actions:** A grid of text links for the news coverage (Channel 13, Mako) and the original Facebook community post.

*   **Box 3: The Brass (2D Part Orienting)**
    *   **Visuals:** A geometric polygon rotates slowly in the center of the card. When hovered, the polygon "pushes" against the cursor to orient itself correctly.
    *   **Content:** Brief on the C++ computational geometry library implementation.
    *   **Actions:** A button link labeled "View Algorithm" pointing to the project page.

*   **Box 4: The Woodwinds (The Turing Jest)**
    *   **Visuals:** Two chat bubbles animating as if they are talking to each other. The design uses a "Arena" style versus layout.
    *   **Content:** Explanation of the LLM pun competition platform.
    *   **Actions:** A "Play the Arena" call-to-action button linking to the site.

*   **Box 5: The Chorus (Rhymes of Israel)**
    *   **Visuals:** The text inside this card uses a serif font resembling a newspaper headline, which animates to "morph" into a handwritten, rhyming script on hover.
    *   **Content:** Description of the Chrome extension for comedic news rhymes.
    *   **Actions:** An "Add to Chrome" badge linking to the store.

*   **Box 6: The Mirror (Portfolio Meta-Link)**
    *   **Visuals:** This card contains a recursive "Droste effect" image—a screenshot of the website within the website, stretching infinitely inward.
    *   **Content:** "A self-referential loop: The site you are currently conducting."
    *   **Actions:** A "Recursion" link pointing to the main domain.

**Social Links & Footer**
Located at the bottom center, three oscillating circular icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook. They bounce slightly in rhythm with the sorting audio.

**The Chronometer**
Fixed to the very bottom right of the viewport is a terminal-style status bar.

*   **The Uptime Counter:** A digital stopwatch font (monospace, neon red) counting up rapidly. It calculates the difference between current time and the hardcoded timestamp `2025-11-25 01:06:16`. The label reads: *"Runtime Duration."*
