### **Portfolio Design: The Digital Constellation**

**Overall Concept:** The website loads as a dark, minimalist, and interactive starfield. At the center is a single, glowing geometric "core." The user's goal is to "discover" the portfolio pieces, which are hidden as dormant stars in a constellation. Interacting with the core reveals the project constellation, and clicking on each "star" brings that project to life. The theme is one of cosmic discovery, where each project is a shining point in the developer's universe of work.

**Initial Page Load & Header**

The page loads to a near-black screen (a deep charcoal, #121212) with a subtle, slow-moving particle animation, like drifting space dust or a faint digital grid.

In the top-center of the screen, the header text appears with a soft, neon-like glow (a cool, electric blue).

**Geva Kipper**
*(in a clean, modern, sans-serif font like Inter or Montserrat)*

**Crafting intelligent systems and developer tools at Google.**
*(in a slightly smaller, thinner weight of the same font)*

Below this, a distinct subtitle appears in a monospaced font (like Fira Code or Source Code Pro) with a subtle, continuous "text-cursor" blinking at the end, as if it's being typed or updated by an AI in real-time.

`[SYSTEM PROMPT]: This design is procedurally generated by AI daily. Refresh for a new experience.`

At the geometric center of the viewport is the "Core": a complex, slowly rotating 3D wireframe icosahedron (a 20-sided polygon). It glows with the same electric blue as the header. When the user hovers over it, it rotates slightly faster and emits a soft hum.

**The Scavenger Hunt: The Reveal**

When the user clicks the central Core, it triggers an animation. The Core pulses brightly, and seven beams of light shoot out in different directions, traveling to specific points on the screen. As each beam reaches its destination, a small, faint, pulsating circular node appears. These seven nodes form an abstract constellation on the page.

Each node contains a simple, minimalist icon representing the project within:
1.  **GlglStats:** A sound wave icon.
2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk:** A map pin icon.
3.  **2D Part Orienting:** A simple polygon shape.
4.  **The Turing Jest:** A jester's hat icon.
5.  **Rhymes of Israel:** A newspaper icon.
6.  **Portfolio Project:** A recursive spiral icon.
7.  **Contact/Socials:** A chain link icon.

Hovering over a node causes it to glow brighter and a one-word title (e.g., "MUSIC," "DATA," "GEOMETRY") to fade in beside it.

**Revealing a Project Section**

When the user clicks on a project node (e.g., the sound wave icon), the starfield animation in the background becomes more active. The selected node expands with a fluid, liquid-like animation into a "Data Card."

The Data Card is not a sharp-edged box but a floating, semi-transparent panel with a frosted glass effect (glassmorphism). Its border glows faintly with the electric blue accent color. All other nodes dim, and the central Core pulses slowly, signifying the user's focus on this one "star."

**Content of a Data Card (Example: GlglStats)**

*   At the top left of the card is the project's icon (the sound wave) and the bolded title: **GlglStats**.
*   Below the title is the project description: "A Python project measuring the repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression, with visualizations of repetition patterns in famous songs."
*   Below the description are the links, presented as interactive buttons with icons and clear labels:
    *   A button with a globe icon: `View Live Project` (links to glglstats.geekip.dev)
    *   A button with a YouTube play icon: `Watch PyData Talk` (links to the video)
*   The buttons have a hover effect where their background fills with the electric blue color. The Meta project card will have a button with a spiral icon that says `You Are Here` and links to the main site. The "Contact/Socials" card will simply have three buttons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook, each with its respective logo.

To close the card and return to the constellation view, the user can either click outside the card or on a subtle "X" that appears in its top-right corner. The card then gracefully collapses back into its node. The user can open multiple cards, which will automatically arrange themselves on the screen in a clean, masonry-style grid.

**Footer**

At the very bottom of the page, centered and in a small, unobtrusive font, is the footer.

`Design generated by a GPT-4 class Large Language Model. |
System Uptime: [A dynamically updating stopwatch showing HH:MM:SS since 2025-09-10 01:00:48]`

The stopwatch numbers will use a classic digital clock font, providing a retro-tech contrast to the site's modern, futuristic aesthetic. This entire footer line will have a very low opacity, becoming slightly brighter on hover to ensure it doesn't distract from the main content.
