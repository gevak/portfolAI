**Matrix Digital Rain Portfolio Design**

The website opens with a full-screen black background displaying authentic Matrix-style green cascading code characters (katakana, Latin letters, and numbers) falling continuously across the entire viewport. The falling code starts dense and mysterious, creating an immersive digital atmosphere. As the user scrolls or waits a few seconds, strategic areas of the falling code begin to slow down and "crystallize" into readable content, with the green characters gradually shifting to white text against semi-transparent dark panels.

**Header Revelation**
The top section emerges as falling code characters align to spell out "GEVA KIPPER" in large, bold typography, with a subtle glow effect. Below this, a single line of code appears to compile in real-time, revealing "Software Engineer at Google, building the future of AI-powered developer tools." Underneath, in smaller, italicized text with a flickering cursor effect, the subtitle materializes: "This portfolio redesigns itself daily through AI - every visit reveals a new digital evolution."

**Five Content Matrices**
The five project sections appear as floating rectangular panels arranged in an asymmetrical grid layout, each emerging from the code rain with a subtle fade-in and upward drift animation. Each panel has a translucent dark background with green-tinted borders that pulse softly. The panels vary in size based on content importance, with GlglStats taking a prominent position.

Each panel contains a glitched-style project title that assembles character by character, followed by clean, readable descriptions in monospace font. Interactive elements like links appear as green highlighted text that glows on hover, mimicking terminal hyperlinks. The project panels include subtle animations - code snippets scroll by in the background, and data visualization elements (charts, graphs) render progressively for relevant projects.

**Interactive Code Elements**
Hovering over any content area causes the surrounding code rain to pause and form geometric patterns or data-like visualizations relevant to that section. Clicking on links triggers a brief "system access granted" animation where code characters swirl around the cursor before redirecting.

**Footer Matrix**
At the bottom, social media links appear as a row of terminal-style buttons, each prefixed with "> " and accompanied by subtle ASCII art icons. The AI credit line appears as a comment in green text (// Designed by Claude AI), while the live stopwatch displays in a retro digital font within brackets, updating in real-time with a gentle pulse effect. The entire footer sits within a command-line interface aesthetic, complete with a blinking cursor.

The overall effect creates a living, breathing digital environment where content feels like it's being decoded and revealed from the Matrix itself, perfectly balancing the iconic falling code aesthetic with clear, professional portfolio presentation.
