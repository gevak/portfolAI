# Snow Globe Portfolio Design for Geva Kipper

## Overall Concept & Layout

The entire viewport is dominated by a large, photorealistic glass snow globe sitting on an ornate wooden base. The globe takes up approximately 80% of the screen height, centered horizontally. The background behind the globe is a deep, warm gradient—midnight blue transitioning to soft purple, suggesting a cozy winter evening. Subtle ambient particles float lazily outside the globe to create depth.

Inside the globe, a miniature winter village scene serves as the portfolio environment. Tiny houses with glowing windows, snow-covered pine trees, and a winding path create the initial "at rest" state. The snow inside has settled at the bottom, partially obscuring six distinct "buildings" or structures that represent the portfolio sections.

## Header & Introduction

Floating elegantly above the snow globe in a sophisticated serif font (like Playfair Display) is "Geva Kipper" with a subtle golden shimmer effect. Below it, in a clean sans-serif (Inter or similar), reads "Software Engineer at Google" in soft white.

Beneath this, in italicized smaller text with a gentle pulsing opacity animation: "This portfolio is reimagined daily by AI—what you see today will never exist again."

A prominent call-to-action appears near the globe: a gentle hand cursor icon with the text "Shake the globe" accompanied by a subtle bouncing animation inviting interaction.

## Interaction Mechanics

When the user clicks and drags the snow globe (or shakes on mobile via accelerometer), the globe physically tilts in the direction of movement with realistic physics. The snow inside swirls dramatically—hundreds of white particles with varying sizes and slight blur create a convincing blizzard effect. The village inside becomes momentarily obscured.

As the shaking stops and the snow begins to settle (over 3-4 seconds with easing), the six portfolio section "structures" rise up from the snow like magical pop-up buildings, each one emerging at slightly staggered intervals with a satisfying micro-animation. The structures glow from within, each with a distinct colored light emanating from their windows.

## The Six Portfolio Sections (Village Structures)

Each project is represented as a unique miniature building inside the globe. When the snow settles, they appear arranged in a gentle arc, like a village square.

**1. GlglStats — A tiny radio tower/broadcast station** with musical notes floating above it in neon pink. When hovered, the structure enlarges smoothly and a frosted glass card slides out from behind showing: the project title in bold, description about measuring Israeli pop-chart song repetitiveness using LZ77 compression and visualizing patterns. Two glowing buttons styled as vinyl records link to the site and the PyData TLV YouTube presentation.

**2. Ahuzat Dibuk — A miniature parking garage structure** with tiny cars visible inside, glowing in warm orange. The hover card reveals the parking lot data visualization project for Tel Aviv residents. Three news story links appear as newspaper icons (13tv, Mako) plus a Facebook icon linking to the original Secret Tel Aviv post.

**3. 2D Part Orienting — A geometric crystalline structure** resembling computational geometry, glowing in electric blue with rotating polygon shapes orbiting it. The card describes the C++ CGAL library implementation for polygon push-plan orientation, linking to the TAU project page.

**4. The Turing Jest — A tiny comedy club building** with a spotlight beam and a laughing emoji floating above, glowing in warm yellow. The card explains the LMSYS-style LLM pun competition arena, with a marquee-style link to jest.geekip.dev.

**5. Rhymes of Israel — A miniature newspaper stand** with Hebrew letters floating around it in playful green. The card describes the Chrome extension that transforms news headlines into yearbook-style comedic rhymes, with a Chrome Web Store installation button.

**6. This Portfolio — A recursive snow globe within the snow globe** (a tiny version of itself), glowing in iridescent rainbow. The meta-description acknowledges you're looking at the project itself, linking to geekip.dev.

**7. Connect Section — A cozy cottage with a mailbox** at the edge of the village, glowing in soft purple. Three chimney smoke trails form the shapes of the GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook icons, each clickable and linking to the respective profiles.

## Card Design Details

When any structure is clicked or hovered, a frosted glass panel (glassmorphism style with backdrop blur) emerges from the snow and floats in front of the globe. The panel has rounded corners, a subtle white border, and contains the project information. Links appear as pill-shaped buttons with hover states that create a gentle glow effect. An X button or clicking elsewhere dismisses the card with a fade-and-sink animation back into the snow.

## Footer & Credits

Below the snow globe's wooden base, engraved into the base itself in elegant script, reads: "Crafted by Claude (Anthropic) • [Live Stopwatch]"

The stopwatch displays in a vintage flip-clock style, showing hours, minutes, and seconds elapsed since December 7, 2025, 01:14:51. The numbers flip with a satisfying mechanical animation, counting upward continuously.

## Animation & Polish Details

- Continuous gentle ambient animation: occasional snowflake drifting inside the globe even at rest
- The wooden base has a subtle reflection on the surface below it
- Mouse parallax effect: the globe slightly shifts perspective based on cursor position
- Soft ambient sound option: gentle wind chimes and snow crunching (muted by default, with a small speaker icon to enable)
- Loading state: the globe appears frosted over, then "thaws" to reveal the scene
- All transitions use smooth cubic-bezier easing for organic movement
- Mobile: tap-and-hold initiates shake mode, with haptic feedback on supported devices
