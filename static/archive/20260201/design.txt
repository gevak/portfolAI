**Global Aesthetic and Atmosphere**
The website should emulate a "corrupted simulation" or a terminal struggling to render in real-time. The initial visual language is heavy on **Chromatic Aberration** (RGB color splitting), **CRT scanlines**, and **Data Moshing**. The color palette should be a deep, void-black background (`#050505`) contrasted with high-voltage neon green, electric purple, and "Blue Screen of Death" cyan. Font selection should pair a raw, jagged Monospace font (like VT323 or Fira Code) for the "glitched" states with a clean, ultra-polished Sans-Serif (like Inter or Helvetic Neue) for the "fixed" states.

**The "Debugging" Scroll Mechanic**
The core interaction principle is that the website appears "broken" below the fold. As the user scrolls down, the action of scrolling acts as a "rendering engine" or a "debugger." Elements entering the viewport should initially appear distorted—text encrypted, images pixelated, and layout skewed—and then visually "snap" into a clean, elegant grid structure as they hit the center of the screen, accompanied by a subtle "decryption" animation (random characters cycling into legible text).

### Section 1: The Hero Header (The Crash)
The page opens with a large, viewport-height section.
*   **The Name:** Display "GEVA KIPPER" in massive, heavy typography. Initially, the letters should twitch and swap using a "Zalgo" text effect. As the page loads, the noise settles into a crisp, bold header.
*   **The Position:** Below the name, a single status line blinking like a terminal prompt: "Software Engineer @ Google."
*   **The Subtitle:** Display a glowing notification box styled like a system alert. The text reads: *"System Alert: This interface is re-designed daily by AI. Current Build: Unstable."*
*   **Visual Flair:** The background of this section should involve a subtle WebGL particle effect that looks like falling "matrix" digital rain or static noise that retreats away from the mouse cursor, revealing the clean dark background beneath.

### Section 2: The Project Grid (The GlglStats & Ahuzat Dibuk)
The projects are arranged in a responsive 2-column masonry grid.
*   **Card Design:** Each project box should have a glass-morphism effect (semi-transparent dark layer with blur).
*   **Project 1 (GlglStats):**
    *   *Visual:* A background visualization of an audio waveform that looks jagged and red (clipping). Upon hovering/scrolling, the waveform smooths out into a gentle sine wave.
    *   *Content:* Title "GlglStats" with the description of the Israeli pop-chart LZ77 compression.
    *   *Action:* Two buttons: "access_site (Link)" and "play_talk (Video)."
*   **Project 2 (Ahuzat Dibuk):**
    *   *Visual:* A stylized map of Tel Aviv. Initially, the map tiles are scrambled visually. They slide into correct placement to reveal the parking heat map.
    *   *Content:* Description of the parking scraper and visualization.
    *   *Action:* A list of "Press Coverage" links styled as news-ticker items (Channel 13, Mako) and a "Source_Log" link to the Facebook post.

### Section 3: The Algorithmic & AI Section (2D Part & Turing Jest)
*   **Project 3 (2D Part Orienting):**
    *   *Visual:* Abstract geometric polygons floating in the card. They should be rotating wildly. When the user focuses on the card, the polygons snap into a perfectly aligned orientation, referencing the "push plan" algorithm.
    *   *Content:* C++ computational geometry library description.
    *   *Action:* A link to the project page labeled "Execute Algorithm."
*   **Project 4 (The Turing Jest):**
    *   *Visual:* The text description should initially look like LLM hallucination text (gibberish latin mixed with code). It quickly "decrypts" into the English description of the LLM pun arena.
    *   *Content:* Explanation of the LMSYS-like arena for puns.
    *   *Action:* A playful button linking to the site labeled "Human_Evaluation_Required."

### Section 4: The Meta & Creative Section (Rhymes & Portfolio)
*   **Project 5 (Rhymes of Israel):**
    *   *Visual:* Newspaper headline typography that jiggles. As it fixes, the font changes to a handwritten "Yearbook" style script for a split second before standardizing.
    *   *Content:* Description of the Chrome extension for comedic news rhymes.
    *   *Action:* A "Download Extension" button styled like a Chrome Web Store badge but with a neon pixel border.
*   **Project 6 (The Meta-Portfolio):**
    *   *Visual:* This card should feature an "Infinite Mirror" effect (Droste effect) showing a screenshot of the website itself, recursively getting smaller.
    *   *Content:* "Portfolio v2.0 - This Website." Acknowledgement of the meta-nature of the project.
    *   *Action:* A link to `geekip.dev` labeled "Recursion_Loop."

### Section 5: The Footer (System Footer)
The bottom of the page transitions into a terminal-style footer.
*   **Social Cluster:** Three large, glitching icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook. On hover, the icons split into RGB layers and vibrate.
*   **The AI Credit:** A small, monospaced line: *"Architected by AI Model. Rendering Engine: HTML5."*
*   **The Temporal Anomaly Timer:**
    *   Since the requested date (2026-02-01) is in the future relative to typical current time, this element must embrace the glitch theme.
    *   Label it: **"T-MINUS / TEMPORAL OVERFLOW ERRR"**
    *   Display a digital stopwatch showing: `YEARS: -01 : MONTHS: -xx : DAYS: -xx`.
    *   The numbers should occasionally flicker to random symbols or count wildly fast, implying a time-travel implementation bug, before stabilizing on the negative time difference between "Now" and the future date of 2026-02-01.

**Interaction Polish:**
*   **Cursor:** Replace the default cursor with a custom crosshair or a blinking underscore `_`.
*   **Scrollbars:** Hide standard scrollbars; replace with a slim, glowing progress bar on the right edge.
