# Portfolio Design Concept: Git Commit Timeline

## Overview
A minimalist, developer-focused portfolio that visualizes Geva Kipper's work history as an interactive Git commit timeline, representing his career and projects as a series of commits on branches.

## Header
The site opens with a terminal-style animation that "types out" Geva Kipper's name in a monospace font, followed by a simple subtitle: "Software Engineer at Google" that appears after the typing animation completes.

Below this, a subtle pulsing text in a smaller size reads: "This portfolio is redesigned daily by AI and is never the same twice."

## Main Timeline Interface
The central element is a horizontal timeline resembling a Git visualization, with branches, merges, and commit nodes. The timeline starts from the left (oldest) to right (newest), with the main branch representing Geva's career progression.

Project nodes appear as larger commit circles on this timeline. When hovering over any node, it "glows" with a subtle animation and shows a tooltip with the commit date and a brief description.

## Project Sections
When clicking a project node, the timeline smoothly zooms in and the selected project expands into a detailed card that slides up from the timeline. Each project card has:

1. **GlglStats**: Represented with music note visualizations that react to mouse movements, showing repetition patterns. Links to the site and conference video appear as terminal commands that can be "executed" by clicking.

2. **Ahuzat Dibuk**: Features a miniature heatmap visualization that shifts colors based on scroll position. News links appear as notification-style pop-ups that can be clicked.

3. **2D Part Orienting**: Shows a subtle animation of a polygon being oriented through a push plan. The C++ code snippets float in the background with syntax highlighting.

4. **Portfolio Website**: This section is self-referential, showing a recursive miniature version of the site itself that zooms when hovered, with a "recursion depth" counter.

5. **Contact**: Social links appear as a branching visualization from the main timeline, with each platform represented by its logo in a minimalist outline style.

## Visual Design
- Color scheme: Dark mode with vibrant accent colors inspired by popular code editor themes
- Typography: Monospace fonts for code elements, clean sans-serif for content
- Animations: Subtle, smooth transitions inspired by terminal interfaces and code editors
- Background: A faint grid pattern reminiscent of commit graphs with occasional "glitch" animations

## Interactive Elements
- Scroll/drag to navigate the timeline horizontally
- Timeline supports zooming in/out to explore different periods
- Each project has custom interactive elements relevant to its content
- Hovering on code snippets highlights syntax

## Footer
A minimal footer displays a precise digital stopwatch counting time since 2025-04-26 01:02:38, with a subtle animation that shows milliseconds.

Next to it, a small terminal prompt with the text "Designed by [AI Model Name]" and a blinking cursor.

## Responsive Behavior
On smaller screens, the timeline becomes vertical instead of horizontal, with projects expanding in full width when selected.
