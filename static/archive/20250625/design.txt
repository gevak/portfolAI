The website opens to a completely black screen. After a one-second pause, a single, thin, white vertical line appears in the dead center of the screen, its full height matching the viewport. Then, the name "Geva Kipper" elegantly fades into view at the top, horizontally centered. Below the name, the sentence "Software Engineer at Google, currently working on building the next generation of cloud infrastructure" fades in with a slightly lower opacity. A moment later, centered beneath that, the subtitle appears in a muted gray tone: "This site is algorithmically re-designed and re-deployed each day by AI. What you see is today's unique iteration." A small, softly pulsating dot at the bottom of the central vertical line subtly invites the user to scroll.

As the user begins to scroll down, the entire initial header section smoothly scrolls up and out of view. The central vertical line, however, remains fixed, acting as a spine for the page. As the scroll continues, a new dot appears on this spine. From this dot, two horizontal lines animate outwards, one to the left and one to the right, creating the top border of the first project section. The scroll continues, extending the vertical sides of a new box downwards, until a second pair of horizontal lines animate outwards from the spine, closing the box. The box itself is a simple, border-only container with a transparent background.

Once the first box is fully "drawn" on the screen, its content animates into place. On the left side of the box, the title 'GlglStats' fades in, followed by the description text appearing below it. On the right side, two clean, text-based buttons materialize: '[View Project]' and '[Watch PyData Talk]'. Hovering over these buttons causes them to subtly glow. The entire aesthetic is monochromaticâ€”black background, white lines, and white text of varying weights and opacities.

This process repeats for the next three project sections as the user scrolls further down a now-extended central spine. The boxes alternate their content alignment to create a balanced timeline effect. The 'Ahuzat Dibuk' box draws itself, with its title and description animating on the right side of the spine and its three link buttons materializing on the left. The '2D Part Orienting' and 'Meta Portfolio' sections follow suit, alternating back to the left and right, respectively. Each section only begins its "drawing" animation as it enters the viewport, giving the impression of an endlessly constructed page, built just in time for the viewer.

For the fifth and final section, a dot appears on the central spine, but instead of a large box, three small, minimalist icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook fade into view, arranged horizontally and centered around the spine. Hovering over an icon causes it to scale up slightly and reveal its name in small text beneath it. As the user reaches the absolute bottom of the page, the central spine's journey concludes. Centered at the very bottom, two final lines of text fade in: the first, in a small, italicized font, reads "Designed and described by a GPT-4 class AI." Below it, a simple digital stopwatch displays the time elapsed since 2025-06-25 01:09:26, with the seconds continuously ticking upwards, marking the age of this specific AI-generated concept.
