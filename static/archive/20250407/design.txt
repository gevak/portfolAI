# Space Exploration Portfolio Design for Geva Kipper

## Overall Theme
A cosmic journey through Geva Kipper's software engineering portfolio, where each project is represented as a unique planet within a vast, explorable space environment. The interface will use parallax scrolling to create depth and immersion as visitors navigate the celestial landscape.

## Header Section
- A starry background with subtle particle animations representing distant stars
- Geva Kipper's name appears as a constellation that forms when the page loads
- A single elegant line appears beneath: "Software Engineer at Google, building the future one line of code at a time"
- A subtitle in a smaller, glowing font: "This cosmic portfolio regenerates daily through AI - return tomorrow for a new experience"

## Navigation
- Small rocket ship cursor that leaves a subtle trail of particles as users move around
- Orbital navigation system: small glowing dots in an elliptical orbit around the page center, each representing a section

## Project Planets

### Planet 1: GlglStats
- A vibrant sound-wave planet with pulsating rings that visualize audio frequencies
- Surface has rippling patterns representing music compression and repetition
- When hovered, the planet rotates to reveal project details and links
- Two moons orbit the planet: one for the website link, one for the PyData presentation video

### Planet 2: Ahuzat Dibuk
- A data-visualization planet with a surface composed of heat-map patterns
- Small car-like objects orbit the planet along geometric paths
- Parking density represented by varying elevations on the planet surface
- Three news/media satellites orbit this planet, each linking to the different publications

### Planet 3: 2D Part Orienting
- A geometric planet with constantly morphing polygon surfaces
- The planet slowly demonstrates the push planning algorithm as shapes on its surface reorient themselves
- Surface has a C++ code texture with subtle glow effects
- A single moon representing the link to the computational geometry library

### Planet 4: Portfolio Planet (Meta)
- A mirrored planet that reflects distorted versions of the other planets
- Surface shows recursive, fractal-like patterns that zoom in endlessly
- Orbited by a miniature version of the entire solar system
- When clicked, creates a wormhole effect that refreshes the page

### Planet 5: Contact Nebula
- Rather than a planet, this is a colorful nebula cloud formation
- Three bright stars represent GitHub, LinkedIn and Facebook
- Each star pulses subtly with its brand color (GitHub: purple, LinkedIn: blue, Facebook: darker blue)
- Hovering over each star expands it briefly to reveal the platform icon

## Footer Section
- A cosmic horizon line with your AI signature: "Design by [AI Model Name]"
- A retrofuturistic digital stopwatch counting time since April 7th, 2025, with glowing digits
- Time displayed as "Mission Duration: XXh XXm XXs" in a space-mission control style

## Interactive Elements
- Smooth parallax scrolling effect as users navigate between planets
- Gentle ambient space sounds that change subtly between project sections
- Slight gravitational pull effect when hovering near planets
- Stars in the background that slowly shift perspective as the user scrolls

## Color Scheme
- Deep space background transitioning from dark blue to black
- Project planets each with their own distinctive color palette
- Accent elements in neon blue and purple for an ethereal glow
- Text in crisp white with subtle glow effects for readability against the space background
