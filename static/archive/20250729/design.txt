### Portfolio Design: "The Living Source Code"

**Overall Concept & Page Structure**

The entire website is presented as a single, vertically scrolling page that mimics a modern code editor view of a source code file, for instance `portfolio.js`. The layout is full-screen with a dark, textured background. On the left-hand side, a fixed column displays line numbers that increment as the user scrolls down. The main content area contains the "code," which is a mix of pseudo-JavaScript syntax and detailed comments. The entire page uses a high-quality monospaced font with ligature support (e.g., Fira Code or JetBrains Mono). The design is clean, with interactive elements that feel native to a development environment.

**Visual Design & Atmosphere**

The aesthetic is "solarized dark" or a similar elegant dark theme. The background is a deep charcoal (#1e1e1e) with a very subtle, almost imperceptible noise or scan-line texture. The "code" features syntax highlighting: keywords like `const` and `import` are a vibrant cyan, strings (like URLs and descriptions) are a warm amber, curly braces and brackets are a neutral white, and comments are a soft, desaturated green. All links are styled as colored strings within the code; on hover, they become brighter and gain a solid underline, with a small "open in new tab" icon appearing next to them. On initial page load, a blinking cursor appears at the top for two seconds before the "code" content fades in, as if being loaded into the editor.

**Header & Introduction**

The page begins with a multi-line comment block (`/* ... */`) that serves as the header.

```
/*
 *  Author: Geva Kipper
 *  Role:   Software Engineer @ Google, building next-generation conversational AI.
 *
 *  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  This site's design is regenerated daily by a generative AI.
 *  Last build: [Dynamic Date] - v2.1.3
 *
 */
```

This block establishes the theme and identity immediately. The "Last build" date and version number would dynamically update, reinforcing the "ever-changing" concept.

**Project Sections**

Each of the six project sections is designed as a collapsible code block, starting with a `▶` icon. Initially, only the declaration line is visible (e.g., `const glglStats = { ... };`). Clicking the `▶` expands the block, revealing the object's contents with a smooth dropdown animation, and the icon changes to `▼`.

Inside the expanded block, the project is defined as a JavaScript object. A multi-line comment (`//`) above the object provides the project description. The object itself contains key-value pairs for technologies and links.

*   **Section 1: GlglStats**
    ```javascript
    // A Python project which measures the repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs
    // based on LZ77 compression and visualizes repetition patterns.

    const glglStats = {
      stack: ["Python", "Data Visualization", "LZ77", "Web Scraping"],
      links: {
        live_site: "https://glglstats.geekip.dev",
        conference_talk: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo"
      }
    };
    ```

*   **Section 2-5:** These follow the exact same format for `Ahuzat Dibuk`, `2D Part Orienting`, `The Turing Jest`, and `Rhymes of Israel`, each with its respective description, tech stack (e.g., `["Python", "Scraping", "Geo-Data"]`, `["C++", "Computational Geometry", "Algorithms"]`), and links. The consistency in structure makes the page feel like a well-organized configuration file.

*   **Section 6: The Portfolio (Meta Project)**
    This section will have a playful, self-referential comment.
    ```javascript
    // This very website. A portfolio designed to look and feel like a single
    // piece of source code. Wait, is this recursion?

    const thisPortfolio = {
      stack: ["HTML5", "CSS3", "JavaScript", "Generative AI"],
      links: {
        source_of_truth: "https://geekip.dev"
      }
    };
    ```

**Contact/Social Links Section**

The final content section is structured as a simple `import` statement or a constant object, consolidating all external social links in one clean block.

```javascript
// --- Connect ---

const socialLinks = {
  github:   "github.com/gevak",
  linkedin: "linkedin.com/in/gevakip",
  facebook: "facebook.com/geva.kipper"
};
```

**Footer**

The page concludes with a final, distinct multi-line comment block that acts as the footer. This block is visually separated by a subtle, full-width horizontal line styled like a code separator.

```
/* 
 *  This portfolio's design was generated by a large language model.
 *
 *  Time since this version went live: [ 00d : 00h : 00m : 00s ]
 *
 */
```

The `[ 00d : 00h : 00m : 00s ]` element is a live JavaScript stopwatch. It will be actively counting up from the specified date and time (2025-07-29 01:21:29), with the numbers ticking upwards second by second. The font is the same monospaced style but highlighted in a distinct color, like magenta, to draw the eye and signify it as a live, running process.
