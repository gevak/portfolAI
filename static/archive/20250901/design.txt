### **Portfolio Design: The Living Circuit**

**Overall Concept & Initial View**

The website is a single, full-screen interactive canvas. Upon loading, the user sees a dark, richly textured background resembling a matte, deep navy blue or charcoal gray circuit board substrate. Across this board are intricate, glowing, hair-thin lines in a soft, ethereal cyan, representing conductive traces. These traces are not static; they have a slow, constant, subtle pulse of light flowing through them, giving the immediate impression that the board is "alive."

At the center of the screen is the main "processor" chip. This is a slightly larger, rectangular node, glowing more brightly than the rest. Etched onto its surface in a clean, sans-serif font is the name: **Geva Kipper**. Below it, in a slightly smaller text, is the sentence: *Currently building the future of search at Google.*

Directly beneath this central chip, a subtitle appears as if it were a flickering LCD display or a piece of digital tape applied to the board. It reads: *This site's architecture is algorithmically redesigned daily by an AI. Its form is ever-changing.* A subtle, occasional "glitch" effect animates this text, reinforcing the theme.

**The Interactive Circuit Board & Nodes**

Radiating outwards from the central "Geva Kipper" processor are the six project nodes and one "I/O port" for social links. These nodes are the primary interactive elements. They appear as distinct hardware components (some square, some circular) soldered onto the board, each glowing with the same cyan light. In their idle state, they simply display the project's title (e.g., "GlglStats", "Ahuzat Dibuk").

Smaller, secondary nodes representing skills ("Python," "C++," "LLMs," "Data Visualization," "Scraping," "Computational Geometry") are positioned along the traces. The traces visually connect these skill nodes to the relevant project nodes. For example, a trace runs from the "Python" node to both the "GlglStats" and "Ahuzat Dibuk" project chips.

The core interactivity is revealed on hover. When a userâ€™s cursor hovers over a project node, the node itself brightens, and a brilliant pulse of light surges from its associated skill nodes, traveling along the traces to converge on the hovered project. This immediately and visually communicates the technologies used for that project.

**Project Information Display**

When a project node is clicked, the entire circuit board in the background dims by about 80%, focusing the user's attention. The clicked node fluidly expands into a clean, semi-transparent modal card that hovers over the center of the screen. The card's design mimics a technical data sheet, using a monospaced font for headings and clear iconography.

Each card is structured as follows:

*   **Project Title:** Large, at the top.
*   **Description:** A concise paragraph explaining the project.
*   **Links:** Presented as a clear, button-like list with icons.
    *   **GlglStats:** A "Visit Site" button (with a link icon) and a "Watch Talk" button (with a play icon).
    *   **Ahuzat Dibuk:** Two "Read News Story" buttons (with a newspaper icon) and one "Original Post" button (with a Facebook 'f' icon).
    *   **2D Part Orienting:** A single "View Code & Details" button (with a code </> icon).
    *   **The Turing Jest:** A "Visit Site" button (with a link icon).
    *   **Rhymes of Israel:** A "Get Extension" button (with a Chrome icon).
    *   **Portfolio (The Meta Project):** A simple "Source Link" button (with a link icon). Clicking this node expands a smaller card with the text: "You're looking at it. This site is a living project, demonstrating interactive front-end design."

Closing the modal (via a subtle 'X' in the corner or clicking outside it) causes it to smoothly shrink back into its node form, and the background circuit board returns to full brightness.

**Social Links & Footer**

The seventh node, located near the bottom of the board, is styled as a "communications I/O port" with three distinct sockets. Each socket is labeled with a universally recognized icon for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook, respectively. Hovering makes the respective socket glow intensely, and a click opens the corresponding profile link in a new tab.

At the very bottom of the page, etched directly into the circuit board substrate in a small, elegant font, is the footer. It contains two lines:

1.  *Designed and described on 2024-05-23 by a GPT-4 model from OpenAI.*
2.  *Time since last AI-driven architectural redesign: [A running stopwatch in a digital, seven-segment display font, showing the hours, minutes, and seconds passed since 2025-09-01 01:13:44].*
