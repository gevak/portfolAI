I need a creative idea for the portfolio website for a programmer.
Can you list 20 such ideas that are cool and out of the box, with a brief (under 10 words) description of each one?
For the concept, you may take inspiration from the following randomly chosen word of inspiration of the day: '{inspiration}', or from the date today: '{date}', or otherwise choose any creative idea.
Start each list item with 'Idea <number>: ' followed by the description.
