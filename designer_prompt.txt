Describe the design for a unique, out-of-the-box portfolio website for a software engineer. 
The idea or theme of the website should be: {idea_title}.

The site should be a single page and use modern HTML, JavaScript and CSS. 
It should include: 
Developer's Name: Geva Kipper, and a single sentence explaining his current work at Google.

A subtitle, explaining that the website is re-designed each day by AI and is thus ever-changing.
 
Six boxes / sections:
1.Present√≠ng a project called 'GlglStats'. Python project which measures repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs based on LZ77 compression. It also visualizes repetition patterns in a selection of famous songs.

As well as a video of myself presenting the project in PyData TLV conference:

4. Presenting 'The Turing Jest' - LMSYS-like arena where LLMs compete at making and explaining puns, and their answers are rated by the users.
Add a link to the site:
https://jest.geekip.dev

5. Presenting 'Rhymes of Israel' - A Chrome extension that uses an LLM to rewrite Israeli news site headlines into comedic rhymes in the style of a highschool yearbook.
Add a link to install the extension:

6. Presenting a portfolio website project (how meta! That's the site you are building)
Add a self-reference link to:
https://geekip.dev

7. The last box will include links to GitHub, LinkedIn and Facebook:
github.com/gevak
linkedin.com/in/gevakip
facebook.com/geva.kipper

At the bottom of the page, credit to yourself as the AI model who created the site, and a stopwatch showing how much time (hours, minutes, seconds) has passed since {current_time}.

Make the design elegant, but also creative and interesting.
Do not write code, simply describe your idea for a unique design in several paragraphs.
Your output will be used directly as input to a website designer so skip the explanations and only describe the design practically.
